Land Mode (Multicopter)

<img src="../../assets/site/position_fixed.svg" title="Position estimate required (e.g.
GPS)" width="30px" />

The _Land_ flight mode causes the vehicle to land at the position where the mode was engaged.
The vehicle will disarm shortly after landing (by default).

::: info
Mode is automatic - no user intervention is _required_ to control the vehicle.
Mode requires at least a valid local position estimate (does not require a global position).
Flying vehicles can't switch to this mode without valid local position.
Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate.
Mode prevents arming (vehicle must be armed when switching to this mode).
RC control switches can be used to change flight modes on any vehicle.
RC stick movement in a multicopter (or VTOL in multicopter mode) will by default change the vehicle to Position mode unless handling a critical battery failsafe.
The mode can be triggered using the MAV_CMD_NAV_LAND MAVLink command, or by explicitly switching to Land mode.
