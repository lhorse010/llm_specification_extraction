Takeoff Mode (Multicopter)

<img src="../../assets/site/position_fixed.svg" title="Position fix required (e.g.
GPS)" width="30px" />

The _Takeoff_ flight mode causes the vehicle to take off to a specified height and wait for further input.

::: info
Mode is automatic - no user intervention is _required_ to control the vehicle.
Mode requires at least a valid local position estimate (does not require a global position).
Flying vehicles can't switch to this mode without valid local position.
Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate.
Disarmed vehicles can switch to mode without valid position estimate but can't arm.
RC control switches can be used to change flight modes.
RC stick movement will by default change the vehicle to Position mode unless handling a critical battery failsafe.
The Failure Detector will automatically stop the engines if there is a problem on takeoff.
