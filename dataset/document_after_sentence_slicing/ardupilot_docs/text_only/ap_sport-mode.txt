========== Sport Mode ==========
Sport Mode is also known as "rate controlled stabilize" plus Altitude Hold.

Note
this mode is not included by default in the firmware built and available on the Firmware Server .
Either the user must build his own firmware with this mode enabled or use the Custom Firmware Server

Overview ========

It was designed to be useful for flying FPV and filming dolly shots or fly bys because    you can set the vehicle at a particular angle and it will maintain    that angle.
-  The pilot's roll, pitch and yaw sticks control the rate of rotation    of the vehicle so when the sticks are released the vehicle will    remain in its current attitude.
-  The vehicle will not lean more than 45 degrees (this angle is    adjustable with the ACRO_BAL_ROLL <ACRO_BAL_ROLL> and ACRO_BAL_PITCH <ACRO_BAL_PITCH> parameters) -  The altitude is maintained with the altitude hold controller so the    vehicle will attempt to hold its current altitude when the sticks    are placed with 10% of mid-throttle.
It will climb or descend at up    to 2.5m/s (this speed is adjustable with the PILOT_SPEED_UP<PILOT_SPEED_UP> and PILOT_SPEED_DN<PILOT_SPEED_DN>    parameters).
The acceleration used to establish these speeds is set by PILOT_ACCEL_Z<PILOT_ACCEL_Z>.
