Blind Spot

Role

Blind spot module checks possible collisions with bicycles and pedestrians running on its left/right side while turing left/right before junctions.

!brief

Activation Timing

This function is activated when the lane id of the target path has an intersection label (i.e.
the turn_direction attribute is left or right).

Inner-workings / Algorithms

Sets a stop line, a pass judge line, a detection area and conflict area based on a map information and a self position.
Stop line : Automatically created based on crossing lane information.
Pass judge line : A position to judge if stop or not to avoid a rapid brake.
Detection area : Right/left side area of the self position.
Conflict area : Right/left side area from the self position to the stop line.

Stop/Go state: When both conditions are met for any of each object, this module state is transited to the "stop" state and insert zero velocity to stop the vehicle.
Object is on the detection area
Object’s predicted path is on the conflict area

In order to avoid a rapid stop, the “stop” judgement is not executed after the judgment line is passed.

Once a "stop" is judged, it will not transit to the "go" state until the "go" judgment continues for a certain period in order to prevent chattering of the state (e.g.
2 seconds).
