Follow Mode
When switched into Follow, the vehicle will attempt to follow another vehicle (or anything publishing its position) at a specified offset.
The vehicle lead vehicle's position must be published to the vehicle in Follow mode using a telemetry system.
The altitude is maintained with the altitude hold controller so the vehicle will attempt to hold its current altitude when the sticks are placed with 10% of mid-throttle.
It will climb or descend at up to 2.5m/s (this speed is adjustable with the PILOT_SPEED_UP<PILOT_SPEED_UP> and PILOT_SPEED_DN<PILOT_SPEED_DN> parameters).
The acceleration used to establish these speeds is set by PILOT_ACCEL_Z<PILOT_ACCEL_Z>.
The following parameters can be used to tune Follow Mode's performance:

FOLL_ENABLE <FOLL_ENABLE>: set to 1 to enable follow mode and refresh parameters
FOLL_SYSID <FOLL_SYSID>: MAVLink system id of lead vehicle ("0" means follow the first vehicle "seen")
FOLL_DIST_MAX <FOLL_DIST_MAX>: if lead vehicle is more than this many meters away, give up on following and hold position
FOLL_OFS_X <FOLL_OFS_X>, FOLL_OFS_Y <FOLL_OFS_Y>, FOLL_OFS_Z <FOLL_OFS_Z>: 3D offset (in meters) from the lead vehicle
FOLL_OFS_TYPE <FOLL_OFS_TYPE>: set to 0 if offsets are North-East-Down, 1 if offsets are relative to lead vehicle's heading
FOLL_YAW_BEHAVE <FOLL_YAW_BEHAVE>: controls whether follow points in the same direction as lead vehicle or always towards it
FOLL_POS_P <FOLL_POS_P>: gain which controls how aggressively this vehicle moves towards lead vehicle (limited by WPNAV_SPEED <WPNAV_SPEED>)
FOLL_ALT_TYPE <FOLL_ALT_TYPE>: allows selecting whether to use lead vehicle's relative-to-home or relative-to-sea-level altitude
FOLL_OPTIONS<FOLL_OPTIONS>: set bit 0 to "1" to enable the common-mount-targeting to follow the target vehicle.
