Follow Mode

Follow Mode
When switched into Follow, the vehicle will attempt to follow another vehicle (or anything publishing its position) at a specified offset.
The vehicle lead vehicle's position must be published to the vehicle in Follow mode using a telemetry system.
The altitude is maintained with the altitude hold controller so the vehicle will attempt to hold its current altitude when the sticks are placed with 10% of mid-throttle.
It will climb or descend at up to 2.5m/s (this speed is adjustable with the PILOT_SPEED_UP and PILOT_SPEED_DN parameters).
The acceleration used to establish these speeds is set by PILOT_ACCEL_Z.
The following parameters can be used to tune Follow Mode's performance:
1.FOLL_ENABLE : set to 1 to enable follow mode and refresh parameters
2.FOLL_SYSID : MAVLink system id of lead vehicle ("0" means follow the first vehicle "seen")
3.FOLL_DIST_MAX : if lead vehicle is more than this many meters away, give up on following and hold position
4.FOLL_OFS_X , FOLL_OFS_Y , FOLL_OFS_Z : 3D offset (in meters) from the lead vehicle
5.FOLL_OFS_TYPE : set to 0 if offsets are North-East-Down, 1 if offsets are relative to lead vehicle's heading
6.FOLL_YAW_BEHAVE : controls whether follow points in the same direction as lead vehicle or always towards it
7.FOLL_POS_P : gain which controls how aggressively this vehicle moves towards lead vehicle (limited by WPNAV_SPEED )
8.FOLL_ALT_TYPE : allows selecting whether to use lead vehicle's relative-to-home or relative-to-sea-level altitude
9.FOLL_OPTIONS: set bit 0 to "1" to enable the Gimbal / Mount Controls to follow the target vehicle.
