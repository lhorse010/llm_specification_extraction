        "explanation": "This formula states that globally (G), if Loiter Mode (L) is active, it implies (→) that the current location (M), heading (H), and altitude (A) are maintained. The continuous nature of this maintenance is captured by the global operator."

        "explanation": "This formula expresses that globally (G), in Loiter mode (L), if the control sticks are released (C), it implies (→) that eventually (F) the vehicle will slow to a stop (S) and hold position (P). The flexibility of pilot control is implicit in the formula's structure."
