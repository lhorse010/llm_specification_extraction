        "sentence": "Normally, in Copter, if arming is setup via the rudder stick, if throttle is lowered to idle in ACRO mode, the stabilization is removed.",
        "formula": "G((A ∧ T ∧ M) → ¬S)",
        "explanation": "This formula captures the normal behavior in Copter. A represents arming setup via rudder stick, T represents throttle lowered to idle, M represents ACRO mode, and S represents stabilization. The formula states that globally (G), if all conditions (A, T, M) are met, stabilization (S) is removed (¬S). The implication (→) ensures this behavior is consistent whenever the conditions are met."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "If a transmitter switch is used with RCx_OPTION ARM/DISARM with Airmode (option 154) and used to arm, then stabilization at idle throttle is still fully active, which is often referred to as AIRMODE.",
        "formula": "G((W ∧ A) → (T → S))",
        "explanation": "Here, W represents the use of the transmitter switch with RCx_OPTION ARM/DISARM with Airmode, A represents arming, T represents idle throttle, and S represents stabilization (AIRMODE). The formula states that globally (G), if the switch is used and the copter is armed (W ∧ A), then even at idle throttle (T), stabilization remains active (S). The nested implication captures the conditional nature of this behavior."

    {
        "sentence": ".. note :: to avoid enabling AIRMODE but still use an ARM/DISARM switch, use :ref:Auxiliary function <common-auxiliary-functions> option \"153\" for the switch.",
        "formula": "G((A ∧ O) → ¬S)",
        "explanation": "This formula captures the behavior of using option 153 for the ARM/DISARM switch. Here, A represents using an ARM/DISARM switch, O represents setting the Auxiliary function to option 153, and S represents AIRMODE being enabled. The formula states that globally (G), if the ARM/DISARM switch is used (A) and option 153 is set (O), then AIRMODE is not enabled (¬S). This elegantly expresses the ability to use the ARM/DISARM functionality without activating AIRMODE, which is the core message of the note. The global operator (G) ensures this behavior is consistent throughout the system's operation."

        "sentence": "AIRMODE can also be set to be active without using the RCx_OPTION switch to arm.",
        "formula": "F(S ∧ ¬W)",
        "explanation": "This formula represents the possibility of AIRMODE being active without the RCx_OPTION switch. S represents AIRMODE being active, and W represents using the RCx_OPTION switch to arm. The 'Finally' operator (F) indicates that this state can be reached at some point in the future, allowing for different ways to activate AIRMODE."

    {
        "sentence": "Setting an RC channel to RCx_OPTION = 84, allows enabling or disabling AIRMODE in ACRO and STABILIZE modes directly.",
        "formula": "G(R → (M → (F(S) ∧ F(¬S))))",
        "explanation": "R represents setting RCx_OPTION to 84, M represents being in ACRO or STABILIZE mode, and S represents AIRMODE. The formula states that globally (G), if the RC channel is set (R), then in the appropriate modes (M), it's possible to both enable (F(S)) and disable (F(¬S)) AIRMODE. The nested implications capture the conditional nature of this capability."

    {
        "sentence": "In addition, setting bit 0 of :ref:ACRO_OPTIONS<ACRO_OPTIONS> will activate AIRMODE in ACRO mode (only) all the time, except if overridden by the above switch, if used.",
        "formula": "G((B ∧ M ∧ ¬O) → S)",
        "explanation": "B represents setting bit 0 of ACRO_OPTIONS, M represents ACRO mode, O represents being overridden by the switch, and S represents AIRMODE. The formula states that globally (G), if bit 0 is set (B) and we're in ACRO mode (M) and not overridden (¬O), then AIRMODE is active (S). This captures the permanent activation in ACRO mode unless overridden."

        "sentence": "AIRMODE has no effect in Traditional Helicopter",
        "formula": "G(H → ¬S)",
        "explanation": "H represents Traditional Helicopter mode, and S represents AIRMODE having an effect. This formula states that globally (G), if in Traditional Helicopter mode (H), then AIRMODE has no effect (¬S). The implication ensures this holds true at all times for Traditional Helicopter mode."

        "sentence": "So if you have it on a switch but then use rudder-arming then you won't get \"airmode\".",
        "formula": "G((E ∧ R) → ¬S)",
        "explanation": "E represents having arming enabled on a switch, R represents using rudder-arming, and S represents getting \"airmode\". This formula states that globally (G), if you have arming on a switch (E) but use rudder-arming (R), then you won't get airmode (¬S). This captures the exclusivity between switch arming and rudder arming for airmode activation."
