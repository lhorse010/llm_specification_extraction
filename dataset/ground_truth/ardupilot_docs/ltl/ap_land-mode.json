        "sentence": "LAND Mode attempts to bring the copter straight down and has these features",
        "formula": "G(L → D)",
        "explanation": "L represents LAND Mode being active, and D represents the copter descending. This formula states that whenever LAND Mode is active, the copter will attempt to descend."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "descends to 10m (or until the sonar senses something below the copter) using the regular Altitude Hold controller which will descend at the speed held in the :ref:WPNAV_SPEED_DN<WPNAV_SPEED_DN> parameter which can be modified on the Mission Planner's Config/Tuning > Copter Pids screen.",
        "formula": "G(L → (D U (A ∨ S)))",
        "explanation": "Here, L is LAND Mode, D is descending, A is altitude at 10m, and S is sonar sensing an object. This formula captures the descent process until either 10m altitude is reached or the sonar detects an object."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "below 10m the copter should descend at the rate specified in the :ref:LAND_SPEED<LAND_SPEED> parameter which defaults to 50cm/s.",
        "formula": "G((L ∧ B) → R)",
        "explanation": "L represents LAND Mode, B represents being below 10m, and R represents descending at the LAND_SPEED rate. This formula ensures that when in LAND Mode and below 10m, the copter descends at the specified rate."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "Upon reaching the ground the copter will automatically shut-down the motors and disarm the copter if the pilot's throttle is at minimum.",
        "formula": "G((G ∧ T) → X(S ∧ D))",
        "explanation": "G represents reaching the ground, T represents minimum throttle, S represents motor shutdown, and D represents disarming. This formula states that when the ground is reached and throttle is minimum, in the next state, the motors will shut down and the copter will disarm."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "Copter will recognise that it has landed if the motors are being commanded to be at low level by the vertical position controller, its climb rate remains between -20cm/s and +20cm/s, and is not accelerating for one second.",
        "formula": "G((M ∧ C ∧ ¬A) → F[1,1](L))",
        "explanation": "M represents motors at low level, C represents climb rate within specified range, A represents acceleration, and L represents landed state. This formula captures the conditions for recognizing a landing, including the one-second non-acceleration period."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "It does not use the altitude to decide whether to shut off the motors except that the copter must also be below 10m above the home altitude, unless a rangefinder is being used, in which case it must be within 2m of the ground.",
        "formula": "G((L ∧ (B ∨ (R ∧ N))) → X(S))",
        "explanation": "L represents land mode, B represents being below 10m above home altitude, R represents rangefinder use, N represents being within 2m of the ground, and S represents motor shutdown. This formula captures the complex conditions for motor shutdown based on altitude or rangefinder readings."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "The rotor still may be at governor speed up until Motor Interlock is removed and disarming occurs.",
        "formula": "G(P → ¬(I ∧ D))",
        "explanation": "I represents Motor Interlock removal, D represents disarming, and P represents rotor at governor speed. This formula states that the rotor may be at governor speed until both Motor Interlock is removed and disarming occurs."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "Using a Weight on Wheels (WoW) switch will increase the descent rate and accelerometer ranges that are acceptable for landing detection.",
        "formula": "G(W → (H ∧ E))",
        "explanation": "W represents WoW switch activation, H represents increased descent rate, and E represents expanded accelerometer ranges. This formula captures the effects of using the WoW switch on landing detection parameters."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "This feature is enabled anytime the LGR_WOW_PIN is not disabled.",
    "formula": "G(¬D → E)",
    "explanation": "D represents LGR_WOW_PIN being disabled, and E represents the feature being enabled. This formula states that whenever the LGR_WOW_PIN is not disabled, the feature is enabled."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "If the vehicle has GPS lock the landing controller will attempt to control its horizontal position but the pilot can adjust the target horizontal position just as in Loiter mode.",
    "formula": "G(GPS → (C ∧ P))",
    "explanation": "GPS represents GPS lock, C represents horizontal position control by the landing controller, and P represents pilot's ability to adjust horizontal position. This formula captures the behavior during landing with GPS lock."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "If the vehicle does not have GPS lock the horizontal control will be as in stabilize mode so the pilot can control the roll and pitch lean angle of the copter.",
    "formula": "G(¬GPS → (S ∧ P))",
    "explanation": "GPS represents GPS lock, S represents stabilize mode horizontal control, and P represents pilot's ability to control roll and pitch. This formula describes the horizontal control behavior when GPS lock is not available."
