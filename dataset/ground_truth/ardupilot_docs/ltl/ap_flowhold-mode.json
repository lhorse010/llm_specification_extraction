        "sentence": "FlowHold mode uses an optical flow sensor to hold position without the need for a GPS nor a downward facing Lidar.",
        "formula": "G(FH → H)",
        "explanation": "FH represents FlowHold mode, H represents hold position."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "FlowHold mode is similar to PosHold mode in that the pilot directly controls the vehicle's lean angles with the roll and pitch sticks.",
        "formula": "G(FH → (R ∧ P))",
        "explanation": "FH represents FlowHold mode, R represents allow roll controlling, and P represents allow pitch control.ling The formula indicates that globally, when FlowHold is active, the pilot has direct control over roll and pitch. This formula doesn't capture the similarity to PosHold mode, as it focuses on the control aspect."

    {
        "sentence": "When the user releases the sticks, the optical flow sensor is used by the autopilot to bring the vehicle to a stop.",
        "formula": "G(R → O∧ F(S))",
        "explanation": "R represents stick release, O represents optical flow sensor use, and S represents vehicle stopping. The formula states that globally, when sticks are released, eventually the optical flow sensor is used, and in the next state, the vehicle stops. This captures the sequence of events after stick release."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "Soon after takeoff or after there have been large changes in the height above the surface the vehicle may wobble as it learns the new height and velocity.",
        "formula": "G((T ∨ H) → F(L ∧ X(W)))",
        "explanation": "T represents takeoff, H represents height changes, W represents wobbling, and L represents learning. The formula states that globally, after takeoff or height changes, the vehicle may wobble while learning."

    {
        "sentence": "FHLD_BRAKE_RATE controls the desired deceleration rate when the pilot releases the sticks",
        "formula": "G(S → (B → D))",
        "explanation": "S represents stick release, B represents FHLD_BRAKE_RATE, and D represents deceleration rate. The formula states that globally, when sticks are released, the brake rate parameter controls the deceleration rate. This captures the conditional nature of the parameter's effect."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "FHLD_FLOW_MAX is the optical flow sensor's maximum rate (in m/s) used when stopping",
        "formula": "G(FH ∧ S → RM)",
        "explanation": "FH represents FlowHold mode, S represents stopping process, and RM represents maximum rate > FHLD_FLOW_MAX. The formula states that globally, during stopping, FHLD_FLOW_MAX determines the maximum rate. This captures the parameter's role during a specific operation."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "FHLD_QUAL_MIN is the minimum flow quality used.",
        "formula": "G(FH → QM)",
        "explanation": "FH represents FlowHold mode,  QM represents flow quality > FHLD_QUAL_MIN. The formula states that globally, the flow quality implies the minimum threshold set by FHLD_QUAL_MIN. This captures the continuous application of the quality threshold."
    },
    {
        "sentence": "If the flow sensor quality falls below this value, FlowHold will act just like AltHold",
        "formula": "G(¬QM → (F ↔ A))",
        "explanation": "QM represents flow quality meeting FHLD_QUAL_MIN, F represents FlowHold behavior, and A represents AltHold behavior. The formula states that globally, if quality is below the minimum, FlowHold behaves equivalently to AltHold. This captures the conditional behavior change based on sensor quality."
