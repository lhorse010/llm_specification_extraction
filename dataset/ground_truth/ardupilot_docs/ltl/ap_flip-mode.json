    {
    "sentence": "Vehicle will rise for 1 second and then rapidly flip.",
    "formula": "F[0,1](R) ∧ X(FLIP)",
    "explanation": "R represents rising, and FLIP represents flipping. This formula expresses that within the next 1 second, the vehicle will rise, and immediately after that, it will flip."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "The vehicle will not flip again until the switch is brought low and back to high.",
    "formula": "G(FM → X(¬FLIP U (L ∧ X(H))))",
    "explanation": "FM represents flip mode, FLIP represents flipping, L represents switch low, and H represents switch high. This formula states that globally, after a flip occurs, there won't be another flip until the switch goes low and then high again."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "An RCx_OPTION parameter must be set to \"Flip\" which is \"2\"",
    "formula": "G(FM → P)",
    "explanation": "FM represents flip mode, and P represents the RCx_OPTION parameter value being 2 (\"Flip\"). "
    },
    {
    "sentence": "Vehicle will Roll right by default but if roll or pitch stick is held slightly left, forward or back it will flip in that direction",
    "formula": "G((¬L ∧ ¬FO ∧ ¬B) → R) ∧ G((L ∨ FO ∨ B) → D)",
    "explanation": "L, FO, B represent left, forward, and back stick positions, R represents rolling right, and D represents flipping in the direction of the stick. This formula captures the default behavior and the condition for directional flipping."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "Vehicle should complete the roll within 2.5sec and will then return to the original flight mode it was in before flip was triggered",
    "formula": "G(T → F[0,2.5](C ∧ X(O)))",
    "explanation": "T represents flip trigger, C represents completion of roll, and O represents return to original flight mode. This formula ensures that globally, when a flip is triggered, it completes within 2.5 seconds and then returns to the original mode."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "Pilot may manually exit flip by switching off ch7/ch8 or by moving roll stick to >40deg left or right",
    "formula": "G(FILP → ((S ∨ (L ∨ R)) → X(¬FILP)))",
    "explanation": "FILP represents being in a flip state, S represents switching off ch7/ch8, L and R represent moving the roll stick left or right >40deg. This formula states that during a flip, either switch action or stick movement will lead to exiting the flip state."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "Flip_Start (while copter is leaning <45deg) : roll right at 400deg/sec, increase throttle",
    "formula": "G((L ∧ ¬A) → (R ∧ T))",
    "explanation": "L represents leaning <45deg, A represents angle ≥45deg, R represents rolling right at 400deg/sec, and T represents increasing throttle. This formula captures the conditions and actions for the Flip_Start phase."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "Flip_Roll (while copter is between +45deg ~ -90) : roll right at 400deg/sec, reduce throttle",
    "formula": "G((A ∧ ¬N) → (R ∧ D))",
    "explanation": "A represents angle ≥45deg, N represents angle ≤-90deg, R represents rolling right at 400deg/sec, and D represents reducing throttle. This formula describes the Flip_Roll phase conditions and actions."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "Flip_Recover (while copter is between -90deg and original target angle) : use earth frame angle controller to return vehicle to original attitude",
    "formula": "G((N ∧ ¬O) → C)",
    "explanation": "N represents angle ≤-90deg, O represents reaching the original target angle, and C represents using the earth frame angle controller. This formula encapsulates the conditions and actions for the Flip_Recover phase."
