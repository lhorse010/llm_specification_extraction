        "sentence": "It places the vehicle into a STABILIZE like mode, and generates bursts of signals (\"chirps\") injected into the control loops at various points and logs the results for math analysis and model generation later.",
        "formula": "F(S ∧ G(C ∧ L))",
        "explanation": "This formula captures the sequence of events: S represents entering STABILIZE-like mode, C represents generating chirp signals, and L represents logging results. The formula states that eventually (F), the system enters STABILIZE-like mode (S), and from that point onward (G), it continuously generates chirps and logs results (C ∧ L). This interpretation assumes the chirp generation and logging are ongoing processes after stabilization."

    {
        "sentence": "If the :ref:SID_AXIS<SID_AXIS> is non-zero, then this modes associated parameters will become visible on the next parameter refresh and entry into the mode will be allowed.",
        "formula": "G(N → X(V ∧ A))",
        "explanation": "Here, N represents SID_AXIS being non-zero, V represents parameters becoming visible, and A represents mode entry being allowed. The formula states that if SID_AXIS is non-zero (N), then in the next state (X), the parameters will be visible and mode entry will be allowed (V ∧ A). This captures the immediate cause-effect relationship described in the sentence."

    {
        "sentence": "Otherwise, an error message will be logged and sent to the ground control station indicating that mode entry has been prohibited.",
        "formula": "G(¬N → X(E ∧ P))",
        "explanation": "In this formula, N again represents SID_AXIS being non-zero, E represents logging and sending an error message, and P represents mode entry being prohibited. The formula states that if SID_AXIS is not non-zero (¬N), then in the next state (X), an error message will be logged and sent, and mode entry will be prohibited (E ∧ P). This captures the alternative scenario to the previous sentence."
