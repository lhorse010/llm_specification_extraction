    {
    "sentence": "This very simple flight mode simply stops the vehicle as soon as possible.",
    "formula": "G(M → F(S))",
    "explanation": "Let M represent the activation of this flight mode, and S represent the vehicle stopping. The formula G(M → F(S)) means that globally, whenever the mode is activated (M), the vehicle will eventually stop (F(S)). This captures the 'as soon as possible' aspect by using the 'eventually' operator F."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "Once invoked, this mode does not accept any input from the pilot.",
    "formula": "G(M → G(¬I))",
    "explanation": "Here, M represents the mode being invoked, and I represents pilot input being accepted. The formula G(M → G(¬I)) states that globally, once the mode is invoked (M), it globally remains true that no pilot input is accepted (G(¬I)). This effectively captures the permanent rejection of pilot input after mode activation."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "This mode requires GPS.",
    "formula": "G(M → G)",
    "explanation": "Let M represent the mode being active, and G represent GPS being available. The formula G(M → G) means that globally, if the mode is active (M), then GPS must be available (G). This succinctly captures the requirement of GPS for the mode's operation."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "For more aggressive braking, you can also try increasing PSC_JERK_XY.",
    "formula": "G(J → F(B))",
    "explanation": "Let J represent increasing PSC_JERK_XY, and B represent more aggressive braking. The formula G(J → F(B)) means that globally, if PSC_JERK_XY is increased (J), then eventually more aggressive braking will occur (F(B)). This captures the causal relationship between the parameter adjustment and its effect."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "When switched on, Brake mode will attempt to stop the vehicle as quickly as possible.",
    "formula": "G(B → X(F(S)))",
    "explanation": "Let B represent Brake mode being switched on, and S represent the vehicle stopping. The formula G(B → X(F(S))) means that globally, when Brake mode is switched on (B), in the next state (X), the vehicle will eventually stop (F(S)). This captures both the immediate effect of switching on Brake mode and the eventual stopping of the vehicle."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "If the vehicle is landed in Brake mode it will immediately disarm.",
    "formula": "G((B ∧ L) → X(D))",
    "explanation": "Let B represent Brake mode being active, L represent the vehicle being landed, and D represent disarming. The formula G((B ∧ L) → X(D)) means that globally, if the vehicle is in Brake mode and landed (B ∧ L), then in the next state it will be disarmed (X(D)). This precisely captures the immediate disarming condition."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "The pilots controls are ignored in this mode.",
    "formula": "G(M → G(¬C))",
    "explanation": "Let M represent the mode being active, and C represent pilot controls being accepted. The formula G(M → G(¬C)) means that globally, when this mode is active (M), it remains globally true that pilot controls are not accepted (G(¬C)). This effectively represents the constant ignoring of pilot controls while in this mode."
    },
    {
    "sentence": "The vehicle must be switched out of this mode before the pilot can re-take control.",
    "formula": "G(C → (¬M U C))",
    "explanation": "Let M represent the mode being active, and C represent the pilot having control. The formula G(C → (¬M U C)) means that globally, for the pilot to regain control (C), it must be true that the mode is not active (¬M) until (U) control is regained. This elegantly captures the sequence of events required for the pilot to re-take control."
