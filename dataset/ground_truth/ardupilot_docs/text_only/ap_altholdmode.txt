In altitude hold mode, Copter maintains a consistent altitude while allowing roll, pitch, and yaw to be controlled normally.
When altitude hold mode (aka AltHold) is selected, the throttle is automatically controlled to maintain the current altitude.
Roll, Pitch and yaw operate the same as in :ref:`Stabilize mode <stabilize-mode>` meaning that the pilot directly controls the roll and pitch lean angles and the heading.
The autopilot uses a barometer which measures air pressure as the primary means for determining altitude ("Pressure Altitude") and if the air pressure is changing in your flight area due to extreme weather, the copter will follow the air pressure change rather than actual altitude.
When fitted and enabled, a downward facing rangefinder such as LiDAR or SONAR will automatically provide even more accurate altitude maintenance, up to the limit of the sensor.
The pilot can control the climb or descent rate of the vehicle with the throttle stick.
If the throttle stick is in the middle (40% ~ 60%) the vehicle will maintain the current altitude.
Outside of the mid-throttle deadzone (i.e. below 40% or above 60%) the vehicle will descend or climb depending upon the deflection of the stick.
When the stick is completely down the copter will descend at 2.5m/s and if at the very top it will climb by 2.5m/s.
These speeds can be adjusted with the :ref:`PILOT_SPEED_UP<PILOT_SPEED_UP>` and :ref:`PILOT_SPEED_DN<PILOT_SPEED_DN>` parameters.
The acceleration used to establish these speeds is set by :ref:`PILOT_ACCEL_Z<PILOT_ACCEL_Z>`.
This param's value should be between "0" and "400" with "0" meaning no deadband.
"100" would produce a deadband 10% above and below mid throttle (i.e. deadband extends from 40% to 60% throttle stick position).
Copter allows arming and disarming in altitude hold mode.
When disarming, the copter may need to rest in the landing position for a few seconds to allow the "landing checker" to verify that the copter has landed before you are able to disarm.
The 1:2 ratio of P to I (i.e. I is twice the size of P) should be maintained if you modify these parameters.
These values should never be increased but for very powerful copters you may get better response by reducing both by 50% (i.e P to 0.5, I to 1.0).
CTUN's BAlt (baroalt), DAlt (desired alt) and Alt (inertial nav alt estimate) The three should track well as shown below.
High vibrations can lead to the copter rapidly climbing as soon as altitude hold is engaged.
The target altitude is set at the moment the pilot switches into alt hold but because the vehicle is rising quickly it flies above the target.
The aggressive altitude hold controller then responds by momentarily reducing the motors to near minimum until the copter begins falling back to the target altitude.
Air pressure changes cause the vehicle to drift up or down by a couple of meters over longer period of time or for the altitude shown on the GCS to be inaccurate by a couple of meters including occasional negative altitudes (meaning altitudes below the home altitude).
Momentary altitude loss of 1m ~ 2m when the copter levels out after a high speed forward flight.
The ``EK2_ALT_M_NSE`` parameter has a range from 0.1 to 10.0 and allows increments of 0.1.
Ideally the vehicle should be able to hover at about 50% throttle (mid stick) and anything higher than 70% is dangerous.
If you incorporate expo on your transmitter, that directly increases the size of the Alt Hold throttle dead band.
