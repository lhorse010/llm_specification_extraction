The target of this module is to stop the vehicle before entering the no drivable lane (with configurable stop margin) or keep the vehicle stationary if autonomous mode started inside a no drivable lane.
Then ask the human driver to take the responsibility of the driving task (Takeover Request / Request to Intervene)
This function is activated when the lane id of the target path has an no drivable lane label (i.e. the `no_drivable_lane` attribute is `yes`).
- Assign the state to `APPROACHING` toward a no drivable lane if:
  - the distance from front of the ego vehicle till the first intersection point between the ego path and the no drivable lane polygon is more than the `stop_margin`
Assign the state to `INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE` if:
  - the first point of the ego path is inside the no drivable lane polygon, or
  - the distance from front of the ego vehicle till the first intersection point between the ego path and the no drivable lane polygon is less than the `stop_margin`
Assign the state to `STOPPED` when the vehicle is completely stopped
