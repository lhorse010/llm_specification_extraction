This module is activated when there is traffic light in ego lane.
If a corresponding traffic light signal have never been found, it treats as a signal to pass.
If a corresponding traffic light signal is found but timed out, it treats as a signal to stop.
Uses the highest reliability one of the traffic light recognition result and if the color of that was not green or corresponding arrow signal, generates a stop point.
If an elapsed time to receive stop signal is less than `stop_time_hysteresis`, it treats as a signal to pass.
When vehicle current velocity is
higher than 2.0m/s ⇒ pass judge(using next slide formula)
lower than 2.0m/s ⇒ stop
When it to be judged that vehicle can’t stop before stop line, autoware chooses one of the following behaviors
"can pass through" stop line during yellow lamp => pass
"can’t pass through" stop line during yellow lamp => emergency stop
vehicle can’t stop under deceleration and jerk limit.(left side of the pass judge curve)⇒emergency stop(relax deceleration and jerk limitation in order to observe the traffic regulation)
vehicle can stop under deceleration and jerk limit.(right side of the pass judge curve)⇒ stop(autoware selects the safety choice)
