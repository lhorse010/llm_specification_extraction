Explanation:

1. The _Hold_ flight mode causes the vehicle to stop and hover at its current GPS position and altitude. (specification: expected post-action)
2. _Hold mode_ can be used to pause a mission or to help you regain control of a vehicle in an emergency. (specification: expected post-action)
3. Mode is automatic - no user intervention is _required_ to control the vehicle. (specification: constraint)
4. Mode requires a global 3d position estimate (from GPS or inferred from a local position). (specification: state transition pre-requirement)
5. Flying vehicles can't switch to this mode without global position. (specification: constraint)
6. Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate. (specification: expected state change)
7. Disarmed vehicles can switch to mode without valid position estimate but can't arm. (specification: expected state change)
8. Mode requires wind and flight time are within allowed limits (specified via parameters). (specification: constraint)
9. RC control switches can be used to change flight modes on any vehicle. (specification: expected state change)
10. RC stick movement will by default change the vehicle to Position mode unless handling a critical battery failsafe. (specification: expected state change)
11. The vehicle hovers at the current position and altitude. (specification: expected post-action)
12. The vehicle will first ascend to NAV_MIN_LTR_ALT if the mode is engaged below this altitude. (specification: expected state change)
13. RC stick movement will change the vehicle to Position mode (by default). (specification: expected state change)
