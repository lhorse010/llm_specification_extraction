**Reasoning:**

**Step 1: Reading the document:** The provided document describes the "Hold Mode" for a multicopter.

**Step 2 & 3: Categorizing and Annotating:**

* **Section 0, Sentence 0:** "The _Hold_ flight mode causes the vehicle to stop and hover at its current GPS position and altitude." - This describes the *expected state change* upon entering Hold Mode. Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 1, Sentence 0:**  Describes the *use case* of Hold Mode, not a specific requirement, constraint, post-action, or state change.

* **Section 1, Sentence 1:** Describes a common *activation method*, not a system requirement.

* **Section 2, Sentence 0:**  Describes a characteristic of the mode (automatic), not a specific requirement.

* **Section 2, Sentence 1:** "2.Mode requires a global 3d position estimate (from GPS or inferred from a local position)." - This is a *pre-requirement* for Hold Mode to function.  Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 2, Sentence 2:** "Flying vehicles can't switch to this mode without global position." - This is a *constraint* related to state transition. Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 2, Sentence 3:** "Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate." - This describes an *expected state change* (failsafe) upon losing position estimate while in Hold Mode. Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 2, Sentence 4:** "Disarmed vehicles can switch to mode without valid position estimate but can't arm." - This describes *constraints* and *state transition requirements* related to arming and switching to Hold Mode. Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 2, Sentence 5:** "3.Mode requires wind and flight time are within allowed limits (specified via parameters)." - This is a *constraint* for Hold Mode. Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 2, Sentence 6:** Describes general functionality of RC switches, not specific to Hold Mode requirements.

* **Section 2, Sentence 7:** "5.RC stick movement will by default change the vehicle to Position mode unless handling a critical battery failsafe." - This describes an *expected state change* when using RC sticks in Hold Mode. Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 3, Sentence 0:** "The vehicle hovers at the current position and altitude." - This is an *expected post-action* of entering Hold Mode. Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 3, Sentence 1:** "The vehicle will first ascend to NAV_MIN_LTR_ALT if the mode is engaged below this altitude." - This describes an *expected post-action* upon entering Hold Mode under a specific condition. Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 3, Sentence 2:** "RC stick movement will change the vehicle to Position mode (by default)." - This is an *expected state change* upon user interaction (stick movement). Therefore, it's a specification.


**Step 4: Formatting in JSON:** The final JSON output is presented above, including only the sentences identified as specifications.
