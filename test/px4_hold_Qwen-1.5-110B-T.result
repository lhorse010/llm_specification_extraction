Based on the provided document, here are the sentences annotated as specifications according to the given categories:

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences are considered specifications because they convey:
- Constraints (section-id 2, sentence-id 1, 2, 5): Requirements for global 3D position, wind and flight time limits, and conditions under which vehicles can switch modes.
- Expected state changes (section-id 3, sentence-id 1): The vehicle ascending to a minimum altitude before hovering if engaged below a certain altitude.
- State transition pre-requirement (section-id 2, sentence-id 4): Vehicles failing safe if they lose position estimate.

Sentences about Hold mode's usage, activation method, or default RC stick behavior are not directly specifying system requirements, constraints, post-actions, or state changes as per the given categories.
