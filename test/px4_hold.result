I'll go through the document step by step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 0: This describes an expected state change, so it's a specification.

Section 1:
- No specifications found in this section.

Section 2:
- Sentence 1: This is a constraint, so it's a specification.
- Sentence 2: This is a pre-requirement for state transition, so it's a specification.
- Sentence 3: This is a constraint, so it's a specification.
- Sentence 4: This is an expected state change, so it's a specification.
- Sentence 5: This is a constraint, so it's a specification.
- Sentence 6: This is a constraint, so it's a specification.
- Sentence 7: This is an expected state change, so it's a specification.

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: This is an expected state change, so it's a specification.
- Sentence 1: This is an expected post-action, so it's a specification.
- Sentence 2: This is an expected state change, so it's a specification.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given objectives and requirements.
