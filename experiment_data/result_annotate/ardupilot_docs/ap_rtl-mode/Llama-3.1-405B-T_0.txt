Based on the provided document, I have annotated the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:
1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here is the output in JSON format:

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 1, Sentence 1: The copter will first rise a minimum of RTL_CLIMB_MIN or to RTL_ALT, whichever is higher, before returning home. (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 3: Under no circumstances will this altitude be below 2m. (Constraint)
* Section 1, Sentence 4: The altitude reference frame is set by either the rally point, if proceeding to one of those, or by RTL_ALT_TYPE to select relative to HOME, or Terrain. (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 5: If WPNAV_RFND_USE = 1 and Terrain is selected, then rangefinder will be used. (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 6: If RTL is entered close to its return point, the altitude Copter climbs to may be limited to avoid unneeded climbs and descents. (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 7: The RTL_CONE_SLOPE parameter determines the slope of an inverted cone centered on the return point. (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 8: This reduces the above return altitude according to: distance from return point * RTL_CONE_SLOPE. (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 9: So if the mode is entered 10m from the return point, using the default slope of "3", then the altitude rise would be limited to 30m before returning. (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 10: It may be less depending on the other parameters, but not higher. (Constraint)
* Section 1, Sentence 11: If the slope were set to "0.5", then the initial climb would be no higher than 5m altitude before proceeding to the return point. (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 12: A value of "0" disables this limit. (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 13: "0.5" is the minimum slope. (Constraint)
* Section 1, Sentence 14: Again, 2m is the minimum return altitude. (Constraint)
* Section 1, Sentence 15: RTL mode requires a reliable position estimate to work properly, most commonly provided by GPS and compass. (Requirement for state transition)
* Section 1, Sentence 16: Default prearm checks will ensure a 3D GPS lock with sufficient HDOP is acquired and your mag is working as expected prior to arming. (Requirement for state transition)
* Section 1, Sentence 17: When using non-default arming checks, make sure you do have a sufficient GPS lock and / or a reliable position estimate for RTL to perform as expected. (Requirement for state transition)
* Section 1, Sentence 18: RTL will command the copter to return to the home position, meaning that it will return to the location where it was armed. (Expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 19: Therefore, the home position is always supposed to be your copter's actual GPS takeoff location, unobstructed and away from people. (Constraint)
* Section 1, Sentence 20: For Copter if you get GPS lock and then ARM your copter, the home position is the location the copter was in when it was armed. (Expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 21: This means if you execute an RTL in Copter, it will return to the location where it was armed. (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 0: In RTL mode the autopilot uses a barometer which measures air pressure as the primary means for determining altitude ("Pressure Altitude") and if the air pressure is changing in your flight area, the copter will follow the air pressure change rather than actual altitude (unless you are within 20 feet of the ground and have SONAR installed and enabled). (Expected post-action)
* Section 3, Sentence 0: 1.RTL_ALT: The minimum altitude the copter will move to before returning to launch. (Expected post-action)
* Section 3, Sentence 1: Set to zero to return at the current altitude. (Expected post-action)
* Section 3, Sentence 2: The return altitude can be set from 1 to 8000 centimeters. (Constraint)
* Section 3, Sentence 3: The default return altitude Default is 15 meters (1500). (Expected post-action)
* Section 3, Sentence 4: 2.RTL_ALT_FINAL: The altitude the copter will move to at the final stage of "
