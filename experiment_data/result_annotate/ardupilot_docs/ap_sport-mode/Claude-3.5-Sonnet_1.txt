I'll analyze the document and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: Now, I'll determine which sentences convey the required information and should be annotated as specifications:

Section 0:
- No sentences qualify as specifications.

Section 1:
- No sentences qualify as specifications.

Section 2:
- Sentence 1: Not a specification (descriptive, not a requirement or constraint).
- Sentence 2: Qualifies as a specification (expected state change).
- Sentence 3: Qualifies as a specification (constraint).
- Sentence 4: Qualifies as a specification (expected state change and constraint).
- Sentence 5: Qualifies as a specification (constraint).
- Sentence 6: Not a specification (descriptive, not a requirement or constraint).

Step 4: Now, I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the output format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given objective and requirements.
