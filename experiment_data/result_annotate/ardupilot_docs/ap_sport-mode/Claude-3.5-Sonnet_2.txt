I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

Section 0:
No sentences meet the criteria for specifications.

Section 1:
No sentences meet the criteria for specifications.

Section 2:
Sentence 1: Not a specification.
Sentence 2: This is an expected state change, so it's a specification.
Sentence 3: This is a constraint, so it's a specification.
Sentence 4: This is an expected state change and a constraint, so it's a specification.
Sentence 5: This is an expected state change and a constraint, so it's a specification.
Sentence 6: This is a constraint, so it's a specification.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given objectives and requirements.
