Let's go through the steps to annotate the sentences as specifications based on the given criteria.

Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I will now determine which sentences convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: I will format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the output format.

Here's the result:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected as specifications because they meet one or more of the criteria:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition
2. Constraints the system must adhere to
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings

The selected sentences provide clear and specific information about how the system should behave in Auto mode, including requirements for engaging the mode, constraints on its operation, and expected actions or state changes during mission execution.
