After carefully reading the document and following the steps outlined, I have annotated the sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 0, Sentence 2: "The vehicle will not flip again until the switch is brought low and back to high." (constraint)
* Section 1, Sentence 1: "1.An RCx_OPTION parameter must be set to \"Flip\" which is \"2\"" (state transition pre-requirement)
* Section 1, Sentence 2: "2.Pilot switches to Stabilize, Acro or AltHold flight mode and puts ch7/ch8 switch to ON position" (state transition pre-requirement)
* Section 1, Sentence 4: "4.Vehicle should complete the roll within 2.5sec and will then return to the original flight mode it was in before flip was triggered" (expected post-action and expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 5: "5.Pilot may manually exit flip by switching off ch7/ch8 or by moving roll stick to >40deg left or right" (expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 7: "1.Flip_Start (while copter is leaning <45deg) : roll right at 400deg/sec, increase throttle" (expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 8: "2.Flip_Roll (while copter is between +45deg ~ -90) : roll right at 400deg/sec, reduce throttle" (expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 9: "3.Flip_Recover (while copter is between -90deg and original target angle) : use earth frame angle controller to return vehicle to original attitude" (expected post-action)

Note that I excluded sentences that were vague or did not convey specific information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes.
