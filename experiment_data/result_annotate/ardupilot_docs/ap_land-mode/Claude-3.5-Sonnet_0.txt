Thank you for providing the document and the task. I'll go through the steps to annotate the sentences that qualify as specifications based on the given criteria.

Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: Here's the formatted JSON output with the annotated sentences:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet the criteria for specifications:

1. They describe requirements for state transitions (e.g., conditions for landing detection).
2. They outline constraints the system must adhere to (e.g., descent rates, altitude limits).
3. They detail expected post-actions (e.g., motor shutdown after landing).
4. They specify expected state changes in response to commands or settings (e.g., horizontal control behavior with or without GPS lock).

The sentences that were not included either provided general information, troubleshooting advice, or were too vague to be considered clear specifications.
