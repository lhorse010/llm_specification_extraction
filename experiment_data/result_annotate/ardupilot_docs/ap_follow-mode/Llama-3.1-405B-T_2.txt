After carefully reading the document and following the steps outlined, I have annotated the sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes.

Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 12
        }
    ]
}
```

The annotated sentences are:

* Sentence 1: "The vehicle lead vehicle's position must be published to the vehicle in Follow mode using a telemetry system." (Constraint)
* Sentence 2: "The altitude is maintained with the altitude hold controller so the vehicle will attempt to hold its current altitude when the sticks are placed with 10% of mid-throttle." (Expected post-action)
* Sentence 3: "It will climb or descend at up to 2.5m/s (this speed is adjustable with the PILOT_SPEED_UP and PILOT_SPEED_DN parameters)." (Expected post-action)
* Sentence 4: "The acceleration used to establish these speeds is set by PILOT_ACCEL_Z." (Constraint)
* Sentence 8: "3.FOLL_DIST_MAX : if lead vehicle is more than this many meters away, give up on following and hold position" (Expected state change)
* Sentence 12: "7.FOLL_POS_P : gain which controls how aggressively this vehicle moves towards lead vehicle (limited by WPNAV_SPEED )" (Constraint)

These sentences convey clear and specific information about the requirements and behavior of the system in Follow Mode.
