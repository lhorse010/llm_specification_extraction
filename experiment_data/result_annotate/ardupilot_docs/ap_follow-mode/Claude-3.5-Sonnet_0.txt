I'll analyze the document and annotate the sentences that meet the specified criteria. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, and annotate them as specifications.

Sentence 0: This is a general description, not a specific requirement or constraint.
Sentence 1: This is a pre-requirement for state transition. Annotate.
Sentence 2: This describes an expected post-action when entering the Follow mode state. Annotate.
Sentence 3: This describes an expected state change in response to specific commands. Annotate.
Sentence 4: This is a constraint the system must adhere to. Annotate.
Sentence 5: This is introductory text, not a specification.
Sentences 6-14: These all describe expected state changes in response to specific settings. Annotate all of these.

Step 4: Now I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the output format.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 14
        }
    ]
}
```

This output meets the requirements by including only clear and specific sentences that describe pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes related to the Follow Mode functionality.
