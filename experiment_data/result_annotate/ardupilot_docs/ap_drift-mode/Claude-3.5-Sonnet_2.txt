I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Here's the step-by-step process:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2: I'll determine which sentences convey information in the categories of "state transition pre-requirement", "constraint", "expected post-action", or "expected state change".

Step 3: I'll annotate the sentences that fall into these categories as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON.

After careful analysis, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they describe specific requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or state changes in the Drift Mode system. They provide clear and actionable information about how the system should behave in various situations.
