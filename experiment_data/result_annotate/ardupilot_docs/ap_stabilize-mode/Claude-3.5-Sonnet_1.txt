Let's go through the document step by step and identify the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read and understood the document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- No sentences meet the criteria.

Section 1:
- No sentences meet the criteria.

Section 2:
Sentence 1: This is a constraint the system must adhere to.
Sentence 2: This is a requirement the system must meet for state transition.

Section 3:
Sentence 1: This is an expected state change.
Sentence 2: This is an expected state change.
Sentence 3: This is a constraint.
Sentence 4: This is an expected state change.
Sentence 5: This is an expected state change.
Sentence 6: This is an expected state change.
Sentence 8: This is an expected post-action.

Section 4:
- No sentences meet the criteria.

Section 5:

Sentence 1: This is a constraint the system must adhere to.
Sentence 2: This is a constraint the system must adhere to.
Sentence 3: This is a constraint the system must adhere to.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ] 
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications as outlined in the objective.
