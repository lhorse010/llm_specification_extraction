I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document about Airmode.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
No sentences in this section meet the criteria for specifications.

Section 1:
Sentence 2: This sentence describes a constraint of the system and an expected state change.
Sentence 3: This sentence describes a requirement for state transition and an expected state change.
Sentence 4: This sentence describes an alternative requirement for state transition.
Sentence 5: This sentence describes a requirement for state transition and an expected state change.
Sentence 6: This sentence describes a requirement for state transition and an expected state change.

Section 2:
Sentence 0: This sentence describes a constraint of the system.
Sentence 1: This sentence describes a constraint of the system.
Sentence 2: This sentence describes a requirement for state transition.
Sentence 3: This sentence describes a constraint of the system and an expected state change.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given requirements.
