Let's go through the document step by step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have carefully read the entire document about the Loiter mode.

Step 2 & 3: Determine and annotate sentences that convey specification information.

Section 0:
Sentence 0: This is an expected state change, so we'll annotate it.

Section 1:
Sentence 5: This is a state transition pre-requirement, so we'll annotate it.

Section 3:
Sentences 0-9: These are all constraints or expected state changes, so we'll annotate them.
Sentences 10, 12, 13: These describe expected state changes, so we'll annotate them.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 13
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that we identified as specifications based on the given criteria. These sentences describe requirements for state transition, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes in the Loiter mode system.
