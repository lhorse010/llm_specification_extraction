Certainly. I'll go through the document step by step and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 2: Expected state change
- Sentence 3: Constraint
- Sentence 4: Constraint
- Sentence 8: Constraint (pre-requirement for state transition)
- Sentence 9: Expected post-action
- Sentence 10: Expected state change
- Sentence 11: Expected state change
- Sentence 12: Constraint

Section 1:
- Sentence 0: Constraint

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. Each specification is represented by its section-id and sentence-id.
