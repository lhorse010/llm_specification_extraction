Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the required information.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.

Step 2: In context, determine whether a sentence conveys information in the following categories: "state transition pre-requirement", "constraint", "expected post-action", "expected state change", or determine whether it conveys no information in any of these categories.

Step 3: If a sentence is categorized as a pre-requirement, constraint, expected post-action, or expected state change, annotate it as a specification.

Here are the annotated sentences:

- Sentence 2, Section 0: "This mode requires GPS." (State transition pre-requirement)
- Sentence 3, Section 0: "Brake mode is subject to acceleration and angle limits imposed by the position and attitude controllers." (Constraint)
- Sentence 1, Section 0: "Once invoked, this mode does not accept any input from the pilot." (Constraint)
- Sentence 0, Section 0: "This very simple flight mode simply stops the vehicle as soon as possible." (Expected post-action)
- Sentence 0, Section 1: "When switched on, Brake mode will attempt to stop the vehicle as quickly as possible." (Expected post-action)
- Sentence 2, Section 1: "If the vehicle is landed in Brake mode it will immediately disarm." (Expected state change)
- Sentence 0, Section 2: "The pilots controls are ignored in this mode." (Constraint)
- Sentence 1, Section 2: "The vehicle must be switched out of this mode before the pilot can re-take control." (Constraint)

Step 4: Format all the annotated sentences in JSON.

        },

            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
