I'll go through the document step by step and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey specification information and annotate them.

Section 0:
Sentence 0: This sentence describes an expected state change, so it should be annotated.

Section 1:
Sentence 0: This sentence describes a state transition pre-requirement, so it should be annotated.

Section 2:
Sentences 0-4: These sentences describe expected post-actions and state changes, so they should all be annotated.

Section 3:
Sentence 2: This sentence describes a constraint and an expected state change, so it should be annotated.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the output in the required format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications as per the given objectives and requirements.
