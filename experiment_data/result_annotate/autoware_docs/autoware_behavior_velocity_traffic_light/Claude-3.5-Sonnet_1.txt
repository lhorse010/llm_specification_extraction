I'll analyze the document and annotate the sentences that meet the specified criteria. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2: I'll now categorize relevant sentences based on the given criteria.

Step 3: I'll annotate sentences that qualify as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the result:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 11
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they clearly specify requirements for state transitions, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes in the traffic light system. They provide specific rules and conditions that the system must follow, which aligns with the criteria for specifications as outlined in the objective.
