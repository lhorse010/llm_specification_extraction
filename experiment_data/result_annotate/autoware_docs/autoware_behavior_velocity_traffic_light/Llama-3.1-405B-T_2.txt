Based on the provided document, I have annotated the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:
1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here is the annotated output in JSON format:

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 1, Sentence 1: "Due to the property of rule-based planning, the algorithm is greatly depends on object detection and perception accuracy considering traffic light." (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 0: "This module is activated when there is traffic light in ego lane." (State transition pre-requirement)
* Section 3, Sentence 1: "If a corresponding traffic light signal have never been found, it treats as a signal to pass." (Expected state change)
* Section 3, Sentence 2: "If a corresponding traffic light signal is found but timed out, it treats as a signal to stop." (Expected state change)
* Section 3, Sentence 3: "2.Uses the highest reliability one of the traffic light recognition result and if the color of that was not green or corresponding arrow signal, generates a stop point." (Expected post-action)
* Section 3, Sentence 4: "If an elapsed time to receive stop signal is less than stop_time_hysteresis, it treats as a signal to pass." (Expected state change)
* Section 3, Sentence 7: "higher than 2.0m/s ⇒ pass judge(using next slide formula)" (Expected state change)
* Section 3, Sentence 8: "lower than 2.0m/s ⇒ stop" (Expected state change)
* Section 3, Sentence 10: "\"can pass through\" stop line during yellow lamp => pass" (Expected state change)
* Section 3, Sentence 11: "\"can’t pass through\" stop line during yellow lamp => emergency stop" (Expected state change)
* Section 4, Sentence 4: "vehicle can’t pass through stop line during yellow lamp.(right side of the yellow lamp line)" (Constraint)
* Section 4, Sentence 5: "vehicle can’t stop under deceleration and jerk limit.(left side of the pass judge curve)⇒emergency stop(relax deceleration and jerk limitation in order to observe the traffic regulation)" (Constraint)
* Section 4, Sentence 8: "vehicle can pass through stop line during yellow lamp.(left side of the yellow lamp line)" (Constraint)
* Section 4, Sentence 9: "vehicle can stop under deceleration and jerk limit.(right side of the pass judge curve) ⇒ stop(autoware selects the safety choice)" (Constraint)
