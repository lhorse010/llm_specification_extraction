Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:
1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 0, Sentence 1: "When the sticks are released/centered the vehicle will level and maintain the current _altitude_." (Expected post-action)
* Section 0, Sentence 2: "If moving in the horizontal plane the vehicle will continue until any momentum is dissipated by wind resistance." (Expected state change)
* Section 0, Sentence 3: "If the wind blows the aircraft will drift in the direction of the wind." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 0: "RC/manual mode like Stabilized mode but with _altitude stabilization_ (centred sticks level vehicle and hold it to fixed altitude)." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 1: "The horizontal position of the vehicle can move due to wind (or pre-existing momentum)." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 3: "RPY sticks levels vehicle." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 4: "Throttle (~50%) holds current altitude steady against wind." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 6: "Roll/Pitch sticks control tilt angle in respective orientations, resulting in corresponding left-right and forward-back movement." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 7: "Throttle stick controls up/down speed with a predetermined maximum rate (and movement speed in other axes)." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 8: "Yaw stick controls rate of angular rotation above the horizontal plane." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 10: "When landed, the vehicle will take off if the throttle stick is raised above 62.5% percent (of the full range from bottom)." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 11: "4.Altitude is normally measured using a barometer, which may become inaccurate in extreme weather conditions." (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 13: "5.Manual control input is required (such as RC control, joystick)." (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 14: "Roll, Pitch: Assistance from autopilot to stabilize the attitude." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 15: "Position of RC stick maps to the orientation of vehicle." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 16: "Throttle: Assistance from autopilot to hold position against wind." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 17: "Yaw: Assistance from autopilot to stabilize the attitude rate." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 18: "Position of RC stick maps to the rate of rotation of vehicle in that orientation." (Expected state change)
