After carefully reading the document and following the steps outlined, I have annotated the sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 2, Sentence 1: "2.Mode requires a global 3d position estimate (from GPS or inferred from a local position)." (constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 2: "Flying vehicles can't switch to this mode without global position." (constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 3: "Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate." (expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 4: "Disarmed vehicles can switch to mode without valid position estimate but can't arm." (constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 5: "3.Mode requires wind and flight time are within allowed limits (specified via parameters)." (constraint)
* Section 3, Sentence 1: "The vehicle will first ascend to NAV_MIN_LTR_ALT if the mode is engaged below this altitude." (expected post-action)
* Section 3, Sentence 2: "RC stick movement will change the vehicle to Position mode (by default)." (expected state change)

These sentences convey clear and specific information about the requirements and behavior of the system in Hold Mode.
