I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document carefully.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the result of the analysis:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet one or more of the criteria for specifications:

1. Requirements for state transition (e.g., "Global position estimate is required.")
2. Constraints the system must adhere to (e.g., "Manual control input is required (such as RC control, joystick).")
3. Expected post-actions when entering a particular state (e.g., "The vehicle will lower propeller thrust, detect the ground and automatically disarm (by default).")
4. Expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings (e.g., "When the sticks are released/centered the vehicle will actively brake, level, and be locked to a position in 3D space â€” compensating for wind and other forces.")

The selected sentences provide clear and specific information about the system's behavior, requirements, and constraints in the Position Mode for Multicopters.
