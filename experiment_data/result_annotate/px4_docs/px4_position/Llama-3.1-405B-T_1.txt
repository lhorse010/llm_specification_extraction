Based on the provided document, I have annotated the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:
1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here is the output in the required JSON format:

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 0, Sentence 1: "When the sticks are released/centered the vehicle will actively brake, level, and be locked to a position in 3D space â€” compensating for wind and other forces." (Expected post-action)
* Section 0, Sentence 2: "With full stick deflection the vehicle accelerates initially with MPC_ACC_HOR_MAX ramping down until it reaches the final velocity MPC_VEL_MANUAL." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 2: "Let go of the roll and pitch stick and give it enough time to come to a complete stop." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 3: "Pull the throttle stick down gently until the vehicle touches the ground." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 4: "Pull the throttle stick all the way down to facilitate and accelerate land detection." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 5: "The vehicle will lower propeller thrust, detect the ground and automatically disarm (by default)." (Expected state change)
* Section 3, Sentence 3: "The approach is the same as above, except that you must manually ensure that the vehicle stays above the landing spot using the roll and pitch stick." (Expected post-action)
* Section 3, Sentence 6: "After the vehicle is on the ground switch to Stabilized mode keeping the throttle stick low, and manually disarm using a gesture or other command." (Expected post-action)
* Section 4, Sentence 1: "Centered sticks level vehicle and hold it to fixed altitude and position against wind." (Expected post-action)
* Section 4, Sentence 2: "1.Centered roll, pitch, throttle sticks (within RC deadzone MPC_HOLD_DZ) hold x, y, z position steady against any disturbance like wind." (Expected post-action)
* Section 4, Sentence 8: "When landed, the vehicle will take off if the throttle stick is raised above 62.5% percent (of the full range from bottom)." (Expected state change)
* Section 4, Sentence 9: "4.Global position estimate is required." (Constraint)
* Section 4, Sentence 10: "5.Manual control input is required (such as RC control, joystick)." (Constraint)
* Section 5, Sentence 1: "If the estimate falls below acceptable levels, for example due to GPS loss, this may trigger a Position (GPS) Loss Failsafe." (Expected state change)
* Section 5, Sentence 2: "Depending on configuration, whether you have a remote control, and whether there is an adequate altitude estimate, PX4 may switch to altitude mode, manual mode, land mode or terminate." (Expected state change)
