Based on the provided document, I have annotated the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:
1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here is the output in the required JSON format:

The annotated sentences are:

- Section 0, Sentence 2: "In this return type vehicles ascend to a safe altitude above obstructions if needed, fly directly to the closest safe landing point (a rally point or the home position), descend to the \"descent altitude\", wait briefly, and then land." (Expected post-actions)
- Section 1, Sentence 0: "1.Mode is automatic - no user intervention is _required_ to control the vehicle." (Constraint)
- Section 1, Sentence 1: "2.Mode requires a global 3d position estimate (from GPS or inferred from a local position)." (Requirement for state transition)
- Section 1, Sentence 2: "Flying vehicles can't switch to this mode without global position." (Constraint)
- Section 1, Sentence 3: "Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate." (Expected state change)
- Section 1, Sentence 4: "3.Mode requires home position is set." (Requirement for state transition)
- Section 1, Sentence 5: "4.Mode prevents arming (vehicle must be armed when switching to this mode)." (Constraint)
- Section 2, Sentence 2: "1.Ascends to the minimum return altitude (safely above any expected obstacles)." (Expected post-action)
- Section 2, Sentence 3: "The vehicle maintains its initial altitude if that is higher than the minimum return altitude." (Expected post-action)
- Section 2, Sentence 4: "2.Flies via a direct constant-altitude path to the safe landing point, which will be the nearest of any rally points and the home position." (Expected post-action)
- Section 2, Sentence 5: "3.On arrival at its destination, it rapidly descends to the \"descent altitude\" (RTL_DESCEND_ALT)." (Expected post-action)
- Section 2, Sentence 6: "4.It waits for a configurable time (RTL_LAND_DELAY), which may be used for deploying landing gear." (Expected post-action)
- Section 2, Sentence 7: "5.Then lands." (Expected post-action)
- Section 3, Sentence 0: "By default the _minimum return altitude_ is set using RTL_RETURN_ALT, and the vehicle will just return at the higher of RTL_RETURN_ALT or the initial vehicle altitude." (Expected post-action)
- Section 3, Sentence 1: "The minimum return altitude can be further configured using RTL_CONE_ANG, which together with RTL_RETURN_ALT defines a half cone centered around the destination landing point." (Expected post-action)
- Section 3, Sentence 5: "Inside the code the minimum return altitude is the intersection of the vehicle position with the cone, or RTL_DESCEND_ALT (whichever is higher)." (Expected post-action)
- Section 3, Sentence 6: "In other words, the vehicle must always ascend to at least RTL_DESCEND_ALT if below that value." (Constraint)
