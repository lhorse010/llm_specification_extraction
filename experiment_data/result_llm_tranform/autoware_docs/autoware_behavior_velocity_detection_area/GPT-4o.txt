  {
    "sentence": "If pointcloud is detected in a detection area defined on a map, the stop planning will be executed at the predetermined point.",
    "formula": "G((D ∧ A) → F(S))",
    "explanation": "Here, D represents pointcloud detection, A represents the detection area being defined on the map, and S represents the stop planning execution. The formula ensures that whenever both D and A are true, eventually S will be executed."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "This module is activated when there is a detection area on the target lane.",
    "formula": "G(A → M)",
    "explanation": "A is the presence of a detection area on the target lane, and M represents module activation. The formula states that if A is true, then M should be true at the same time."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "1.Gets a detection area and stop line from map information and confirms if there is pointcloud in the detection area",
    "formula": "G((A ∧ L) → F(D))",
    "explanation": "A represents obtaining a detection area, L represents obtaining a stop line, and D represents confirming pointcloud detection. The formula ensures that once A and L are true, D will eventually be confirmed."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "2.Inserts stop point l[m] in front of the stop line",
    "formula": "G(L → F(I))",
    "explanation": "L indicates the presence of a stop line, and I represents the insertion of a stop point at l[m]. The formula ensures that when L is true, I will eventually occur."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "4.Sets velocity as zero behind the stop line when the ego-vehicle is in front of the pass judge point",
    "formula": "G((E ∧ F) → V)",
    "explanation": "E represents the ego-vehicle being in front of the pass judge point, F is the condition of being behind the stop line, and V represents setting the velocity to zero. The formula states that when E and F are true, V is also true."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "5.If the ego vehicle has passed the pass judge point already, it doesn’t stop and pass through.",
    "formula": "G(P → ¬S)",
    "explanation": "P indicates that the ego vehicle has passed the pass judge point, and S represents stopping. The formula ensures that if P is true, then S is false, meaning the vehicle will not stop."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "If the vehicle is stopped within hold_stop_margin_distance meters from stop point of the module (_front_to_stop_line < hold_stop_margin_distance), the module judges that the vehicle has already stopped for the module's stop point and plans to keep stopping current position even if the vehicle is stopped due to other factors.",
    "formula": "G((H ∧ ¬M) → (J ∧ G(C)))",
    "explanation": "H represents the vehicle being within hold_stop_margin_distance, M is the vehicle moving, J indicates the judgment of the vehicle having stopped, and C represents continuing to stop. The formula states that if H is true and M is false, then J is true and C will continue to hold."
