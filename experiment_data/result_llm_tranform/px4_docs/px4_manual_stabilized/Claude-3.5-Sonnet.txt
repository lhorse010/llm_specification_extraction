    "sentence": "The _Stabilized_ manual mode stabilizes and levels the multicopter when the RC control sticks are centred.",
    "formula": "G(C → X(S ∧ L))",
    "explanation": "This formula states that globally (G), whenever the RC control sticks are centered (C), in the next state (X), the multicopter will be stabilized (S) and leveled (L). As an expert, I note that this assumes instantaneous response, which may not be realistic in practice. A more nuanced formula might include a time bound."

  {
    "sentence": "When sticks are outside the centre, the roll and pitch sticks control the _angle_ of the vehicle (attitude) around the respective axes, the yaw stick controls the rate of rotation above the horizontal plane, and the throttle controls altitude/speed.",
    "formula": "G(¬C → (R ∧ P ∧ Y ∧ T))",
    "explanation": "This formula expresses that globally (G), when the sticks are not centered (¬C), roll (R), pitch (P), yaw (Y), and throttle (T) controls are active. As an expert, I point out that this formula doesn't capture the continuous nature of control inputs, which could be better expressed in a hybrid logic."

    "sentence": "The pilot's inputs are passed as roll and pitch angle commands and a yaw rate command.",

    "explanation": "This formula expresses that globally (G), when the sticks are centered (C) and within the deadzone (D), eventually (F) the roll (Rz) and pitch (Pz) angles will be zero, and the attitude will be level (L).

    "explanation": "This formula expresses that globally (G), when there's non-zero roll or pitch input (Rn ∨ Pn), in the next state (X) there will be tilt (T) and movement (M). As an expert, I observe that this simplification doesn't capture the continuous nature of the control or the relationship between tilt angle and movement velocity."

    "formula": "G(Tn → X(V))",
    "explanation": "This formula states that globally (G), when there's non-zero throttle input (Tn), in the next state (X) there will be vertical speed change (V). As an expert, I note that this doesn't capture the continuous nature of throttle control or its effects on movement in other axes, which would require a more complex model."
