  {
    "sentence": "When the sticks are released/centered the vehicle will level and maintain the current _altitude_.",
    "formula": "G(C → (L ∧ G(A)))",
    "explanation": "C represents the sticks being centered, L represents the vehicle leveling, and A represents maintaining the current altitude. This ensures that when the sticks are centered, the vehicle levels and holds its altitude."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Throttle (~50%) holds current altitude steady against wind.",
    "formula": "G(T → A)",
    "explanation": "T represents the throttle set to approximately 50%, and A represents holding the current altitude steady. This indicates that setting the throttle to 50% maintains altitude despite wind."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "When landed, the vehicle will take off if the throttle stick is raised above 62.5% percent (of the full range from bottom).",
    "formula": "G(L → (T > 0.625 → F(T)))",
    "explanation": "L represents the vehicle being landed, and T > 0.625 represents the throttle raised above 62.5%. F(T) indicates that the vehicle will take off eventually if the condition is met."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "RC/manual mode like Stabilized mode but with _altitude stabilization_ (centred sticks level vehicle and hold it to fixed altitude).",
    "formula": "G(C → (L ∧ G(A)))",
    "explanation": "C represents centered sticks, L represents leveling the vehicle, and A represents holding fixed altitude. It indicates that in this mode, centering the sticks levels the vehicle and stabilizes altitude."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "RPY sticks levels vehicle.",
    "formula": "G(R → L)",
    "explanation": "R represents the RPY sticks being manipulated, and L represents the vehicle leveling. This states that adjusting RPY sticks leads to leveling the vehicle."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Throttle stick controls up/down speed with a predetermined maximum rate (and movement speed in other axes).",
    "formula": "G(T → (U ∧ M))",
    "explanation": "T represents the throttle stick position, U represents controlling up/down speed, and M represents movement speed in other axes. This indicates that throttle stick affects these speeds within limits."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Altitude is normally measured using a barometer, which may become inaccurate in extreme weather conditions.",
    "formula": "G(B → (¬W → A))",
    "explanation": "B represents using a barometer for altitude measurement, W represents extreme weather conditions, and A represents accurate altitude measurement. It implies barometer accuracy except in extreme conditions."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Vehicles that include a LIDAR/range sensor will be able to control altitude with greater reliability and accuracy.",
    "formula": "G(L → (R ∧ A))",
    "explanation": "L represents the presence of LIDAR/range sensors, R represents reliability, and A represents accurate altitude control. This ensures better altitude control with these sensors."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Roll/Pitch sticks control tilt angle in respective orientations, resulting in corresponding left-right and forward-back movement.",
    "formula": "G(R → (T ∧ M))",
    "explanation": "R represents the roll/pitch sticks, T represents controlling tilt angle, and M represents resulting movement. This indicates tilt control and resulting movement is managed through these sticks."
