After carefully reading the document and following the steps outlined, I have identified the sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        }
    ]
}
```

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 0, Sentence 1: "The roll, pitch and yaw sticks control the rate of angular rotation around the respective axes and throttle is passed directly to control allocation." (Expected post-action)
* Section 0, Sentence 2: "When sticks are centered the vehicle will stop rotating, but remain in its current orientation (on its side, inverted, or whatever) and moving according to its current momentum." (Expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 1: "RC Roll/Pitch/Yaw (RPY) stick inputs control the rate of angular rotation around the respective axes." (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 2: "Throttle is passed directly to control allocation." (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 3: "When sticks are centered the vehicle will stop rotating, but remain in its current orientation (not necessarily level) and moving according to its current momentum." (Expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 5: "1.Roll, Pitch, Yaw: Assistance from autopilot to stabilize the attitude rate." (Constraint)
* Section 1, Sentence 6: "Position of RC stick maps to the rate of rotation of vehicle in that orientation." (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 7: "2.Throttle: Manual control via RC sticks." (Expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 8: "RC input is sent directly to control allocation." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 1: "The curve enables a high turn rate at maximum stick input for performing acrobatic maneuvers, and a zone of lower sensitivity close to the stick center for small corrections." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 2: "This roll and pitch input stick response can be tuned using the MC_ACRO_EXPO and MC_ACRO_SUPEXPO \"exponential\" parameters, while the yaw stick input response is tuned using MC_ACRO_EXPO_Y and MC_ACRO_SUPEXPOY." (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 3: "MC_ACRO_EXPO and MC_ACRO_EXPO_Y tune the curve(s) between a linear and cubic curve as shown below." (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 4: "MC_ACRO_SUPEXPO and MC_ACRO_SUPEXPOY allow the shape to be further tuned, modifying the width of the area of reduced sensitivity." (Constraint)

Note that some sentences may convey information in multiple categories, but I have only annotated each sentence once according to the primary category it belongs to.
