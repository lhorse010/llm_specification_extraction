Let's go through the document step by step to identify and annotate sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document about the Position Slow Mode for Multicopters.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 4: Constraint on velocity limits
- Sentence 5: Constraint on priority of velocity limit settings
- Sentence 6: Constraint on maximum limit values

Section 1:
- Sentence 5: Constraint on parameter usage for limits

Section 2:
- Sentence 2: Expected state change based on input control setting
- Sentence 3: Expected state change based on input control setting
- Sentence 4: Constraint on priority of RC control input

Section 3:
- Sentences 0-4: These collectively describe the steps for setting up RC control, which can be considered as requirements for state transition.

Section 4:
- Sentence 2: Expected state change using MAVLink message
- Sentence 3: Constraint on MAVLink limit values
- Sentence 4: Expected state change and constraint on limit value updates

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. These sentences describe requirements for state transition, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, and expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings.
