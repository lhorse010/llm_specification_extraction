Let's go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate if appropriate.

Section 0:
Sentence 1: Not a specification.
Sentence 2: This is an expected state change. Annotate.
Sentence 3: This describes an expected state change. Annotate.

Section 1:
No sentences meet the criteria.

Section 2:
Sentences 0-5: These describe expected post-actions for landing. Annotate all.

Section 3:
No sentences meet the criteria for specifications.

Section 4:
Sentence 1: This is an expected state change. Annotate.
Sentence 2: This is a constraint and expected state change. Annotate.
Sentences 4-6: These describe expected state changes. Annotate.
Sentence 8: This is a state transition pre-requirement. Annotate.
Sentences 9-10: These are system requirements. Annotate.
Sentences 11-13: These describe expected state changes. Annotate.

Section 5:
Sentence 0: This is a constraint. Annotate.
Sentences 1-2: These describe expected state changes. Annotate.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.
