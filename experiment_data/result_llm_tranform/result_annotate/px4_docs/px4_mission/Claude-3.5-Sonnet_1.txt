I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that match the given criteria for specifications. Then, I'll format the results in the requested JSON format.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2-3: Determine and annotate sentences that convey specification information.

Section 1:
No sentences meet the criteria.

Section 2:
Sentences 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 convey requirements or constraints:
- Sentence 0: Requirement for state transition (global 3D position estimate)
- Sentence 1: Requirement for state transition (vehicle must be armed)
- Sentence 2: Constraint (no user intervention required)
- Sentence 4: Expected state change (RC stick movement changes vehicle to Position mode)
- Sentence 5: Constraint (applies to multicopters and VTOL in MC mode)

Section 3:
Sentences 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 21 convey expected post-actions, state changes, or constraints:
- Sentence 5: Expected post-action (vehicle will hold if flying)
- Sentence 6: Expected post-action (vehicle will "wait" if landed)
- Sentence 7: Expected state change (execute mission from current step)
- Sentence 8: Constraint (TAKEOFF item treated as normal waypoint)
- Sentence 10: Expected state change (execute mission/flight plan)
- Sentence 11: Expected post-action (fly to minimum altitude before executing remainder of flight plan)
- Sentence 13: Expected post-action (vehicle will hold if flying)
- Sentence 14: Expected post-action (vehicle will "wait" if landed)
- Sentence 16: Constraint (mission resets only when vehicle is disarmed or new mission uploaded)
- Sentence 17: Expected state change (missions can be paused and resumed)
- Sentence 18: Expected post-action (resume heading towards original waypoint)
- Sentence 19: Expected post-action (retrace path for camera missions)
- Sentence 21: Expected state change (current active mission item set to 1 when new mission uploaded while paused)

Sections 4-5:
No sentences meet the criteria.

Section 6:
Sentences 0 and 1 convey constraints:
- Sentence 0: Constraint (PX4 runs feasibility checks)
- Sentence 1: Constraint (mission cannot start if checks fail)

Sections 7-9:
No sentences meet the criteria.

Section 10:
Sentences 0, 1, 2, and 4 convey constraints or expected post-actions:
- Sentence 0: Constraint (PX4 expects straight line between waypoints)
- Sentence 1: Expected post-action (MC vehicles change speed when approaching or leaving waypoints)
- Sentence 2: Expected post-action (vehicle follows smooth rounded curve towards next waypoint)
- Sentence 4: Expected state change (vehicles switch to next waypoint when entering acceptance radius)

Section 11:
Sentences 1, 2, and 3 convey expected post-actions:
- Sentence 1: Expected post-action (ascend vertically to minimum takeoff altitude, then head towards 3D position)
- Sentence 2: Expected post-action (ascend to minimum takeoff altitude, then proceed to first Waypoint)
- Sentence 3: Expected post-action (takeoff mission item treated as normal waypoint if already flying)

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.
