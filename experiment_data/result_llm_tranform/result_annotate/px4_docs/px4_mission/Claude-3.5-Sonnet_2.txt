I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences that match the criteria for specifications. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 and 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the result:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 16
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 18
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 19
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 21
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 10,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 10,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 10,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 11,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 11,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 11,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they describe specific requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or state changes related to the Mission Mode for multicopters. They provide clear and specific information about how the system should behave in various situations, which is crucial for software engineering and quality assurance purposes.
