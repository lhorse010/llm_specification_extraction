I'll go through the document step by step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications. Here's the analysis:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now identify sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, and annotate them as specifications.

Section 1:
No sentences meet the criteria.

Section 2:
- Sentence 1: Constraint
- Sentence 2: State transition pre-requirement
- Sentence 3: Constraint
- Sentence 4: Expected state change
- Sentence 5: Constraint
- Sentence 6: Constraint

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: State transition pre-requirement
- Sentence 1: Expected post-action

Section 4:
No sentences meet the criteria. The sentences here are too vague to be considered specifications.

Section 5:
No sentences meet the criteria.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes only the sentences that clearly convey specification information as per the given criteria.
