Let's go through the document step by step and identify the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document about the Orbit (Multicopter) flight mode.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate if they do.

Section 1 (section-id: 1):
- Sentence 1: Constraint
- Sentence 2: Requirement for state transition
- Sentence 3: Constraint
- Sentence 4: Expected state change
- Sentence 5: Constraint
- Sentence 6: Requirement for state transition

Section 2 (section-id: 2):
- Sentence 0: Requirement for state transition
- Sentence 1: Expected state change
- Sentence 11: Constraint
- Sentence 14: Constraint
- Sentence 15: Constraint
- Sentence 17: Expected state change

Section 3 (section-id: 3):
- Sentence 2: Constraint

Section 4 (section-id: 4):
- Sentence 1: Expected state change
- Sentence 2: Constraint and expected state change

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 14
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 17
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the criteria provided. These sentences cover requirements for state transition, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes related to the Orbit (Multicopter) flight mode.
