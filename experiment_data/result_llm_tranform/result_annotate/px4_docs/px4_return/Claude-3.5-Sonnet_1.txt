Let's go through the document step by step and identify the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- No sentences meet the criteria for specifications.

Section 1:
- Sentence 1: Requirement for state transition (automatic mode).
- Sentence 2: Requirement for state transition (global 3D position estimate).
- Sentence 3: Constraint (can't switch to this mode without global position).
- Sentence 4: Expected state change (failsafe if position estimate is lost).
- Sentence 5: Requirement for state transition (home position must be set).
- Sentence 6: Constraint (prevents arming).
- Sentence 7: Expected state change (RC stick movement changes to Position mode).

Section 2:
- Sentence 2: Expected post-action (ascends to minimum return altitude).
- Sentence 3: Constraint (maintains initial altitude if higher than minimum return altitude).
- Sentence 4: Expected post-action (flies to safe landing point).
- Sentence 5: Expected post-action (descends to "descent altitude").
- Sentence 6: Expected post-action (waits for configurable time).
- Sentence 7: Expected post-action (lands).

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change (returns at higher of RTL_RETURN_ALT or initial altitude).
- Sentence 6: Constraint (must always ascend to at least RTL_DESCEND_ALT if below that value).

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,

        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given requirements.
