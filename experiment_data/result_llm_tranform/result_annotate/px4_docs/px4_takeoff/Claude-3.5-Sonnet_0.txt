I'll analyze the document step by step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document about the Takeoff Mode for Multicopters.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- No sentences meet the criteria for specifications.

Section 1:
- Sentence 1: Not a specification (general information).
- Sentence 2: Meets criteria 1 (requirement for state transition).
- Sentence 3: Meets criteria 2 (constraint).
- Sentence 4: Meets criteria 4 (expected state change).
- Sentence 5: Meets criteria 2 (constraint).
- Sentence 6: Not specific enough to be a specification.
- Sentence 7: Meets criteria 4 (expected state change).

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Meets criteria 3 (expected post-action).
- Sentence 1: Meets criteria 4 (expected state change).

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ] 
}
```

This output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given requirements and constraints.
