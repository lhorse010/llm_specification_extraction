Let's go through the steps to annotate the sentences as specifications based on the given criteria.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the document carefully.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

After analyzing the document, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications according to the given criteria:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet the criteria for specifications:

1. Section 1, Sentence 1: Describes a requirement for state transition (valid local position estimate).
2. Section 1, Sentence 2: States a constraint for flying vehicles.
3. Section 1, Sentence 3: Describes an expected state change (failsafe) in response to losing position estimate.
4. Section 1, Sentence 4: States a constraint for disarmed vehicles.
5. Section 1, Sentence 6: Describes an expected state change in response to RC stick movement.
6. Section 1, Sentence 7: Describes an expected post-action (stopping engines) in response to a problem during takeoff.
7. Section 2, Sentence 0: Describes the expected state change and post-action for the takeoff mode.

The other sentences were excluded either because they were too vague or didn't meet the specific criteria for specifications as defined in the objective.
