I'll go through the document step by step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

Section 0:
Sentence 0: This sentence describes an expected state change, so it should be annotated.

Section 1:
Sentence 0: This sentence describes a requirement for state transition, so it should be annotated.

Section 2:
Sentence 0: This is a description of an algorithm step, not a specification.
Sentence 1: This is a description of an algorithm step, not a specification.
Sentence 2: This is a description of an algorithm step, not a specification.
Sentence 3: This sentence describes an expected state change, so it should be annotated.
Sentence 4: This sentence describes an expected state change, so it should be annotated.

Section 3:
Sentence 0: This is an explanation of a problem, not a specification.
Sentence 1: This sentence mentions a parameter but doesn't specify a requirement or constraint, so it's not a specification.
Sentence 2: This sentence describes an expected state change and a constraint, so it should be annotated.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the output in the required format:

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ] 
}
```

This output includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications according to the given guidelines.
