Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

* Section 0, Sentence 0: This sentence specifies the condition for executing stop planning, which is a state transition.
* Section 1, Sentence 0: This sentence specifies the activation timing of the module, which is a constraint.
* Section 2, Sentences 0-4: These sentences specify the expected post-actions and state changes of the system when executing the stop planning algorithm.
* Section 3, Sentence 2: This sentence specifies the condition for judging that the vehicle has already stopped for the module's stop point, which is a state transition.

The following sentences were excluded because they are either vague or do not convey any information in the specified categories:

* Section 3, Sentence 0: This sentence is vague and does not specify any clear requirement or constraint.
* Section 3, Sentence 1: This sentence only mentions the existence of a parameter, but does not specify any clear requirement or constraint.
