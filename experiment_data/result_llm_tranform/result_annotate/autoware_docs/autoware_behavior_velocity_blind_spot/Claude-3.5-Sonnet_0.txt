I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

Section 0:
- Sentence 0: This is a general description, not a specification.

Section 1:
- Sentence 0: This is a specification as it describes a requirement for state transition (activation).

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: This is a specification as it describes expected post-actions when entering a particular state.
- Sentences 1-4: These are not specifications as they are describing components rather than requirements or constraints.
- Sentence 5: This is a specification as it describes conditions for state transition and expected state changes.
- Sentences 6-7: These are part of the specification in sentence 5, but they are not complete sentences on their own.
- Sentence 8: This is a specification as it describes a constraint on the system's behavior.
- Sentence 9: This is a specification as it describes requirements for state transition and expected state changes.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes only the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications as per the given objective and requirements.
