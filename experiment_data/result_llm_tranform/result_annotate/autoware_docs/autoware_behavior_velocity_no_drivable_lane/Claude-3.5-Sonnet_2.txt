I've carefully read and analyzed the document. Now, I'll annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given categories. Here's the result in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected as specifications because they meet the criteria outlined in the objective:

1. Section 0, Sentence 9: This sentence describes the expected state changes and post-actions of the system when encountering a no drivable lane.

2. Section 1, Sentence 0: This sentence specifies the requirement for the system to transition to an active state.

3. Section 2, Sentence 2: This sentence describes an expected state change of the system.

4. Section 2, Sentence 4: This sentence specifies a constraint for the system to transition to the APPROACHING state.

5. Section 2, Sentence 6: This sentence specifies a condition for the system to transition to the INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE state.

6. Section 2, Sentence 7: This sentence specifies another condition for the system to transition to the INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE state.

7. Section 2, Sentence 8: This sentence describes an expected state change of the system when the vehicle stops.

These sentences provide clear and specific information about state transitions, constraints, expected post-actions, and state changes, making them suitable as specifications for the system.
