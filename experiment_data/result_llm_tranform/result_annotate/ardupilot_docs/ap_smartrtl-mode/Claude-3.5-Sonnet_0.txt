I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 5: Constraint on buffer size
- Sentence 7: Constraint on point saving frequency and distance
- Sentence 9: Expected post-action for point simplification
- Sentence 10: Expected state change for point simplification
- Sentence 14: Expected state change for failsafe conditions
- Sentence 15: Expected state change for failsafe conditions

Section 1:
- Sentence 0: Requirement for state transition (arming with good position estimate)

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change for return speed
- Sentence 1: Constraint on default return speed
- Sentence 2: Expected state change for final altitude
- Sentence 3: Constraint on simplification and pruning accuracy
- Sentence 6: Constraint on maximum number of stored points
- Sentence 9: Expected state change for pilot yaw commands

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change for deactivating SmartRTL mode

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 14
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications, following the given requirements and format.
