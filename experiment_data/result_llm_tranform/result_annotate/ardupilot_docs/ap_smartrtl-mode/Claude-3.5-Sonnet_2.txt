Thank you for providing the document. I'll go through the steps to annotate the sentences that qualify as specifications based on the given criteria. Let's begin:

Step 1: I have thoroughly read the document.

Step 2 & 3: I've analyzed each sentence to determine if it conveys information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes. I'll annotate the sentences that qualify as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON as per the required output format.

Here's the result:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 14
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet one or more of the criteria for specifications:

1. Requirements for state transition
2. Constraints the system must adhere to
3. Expected post-actions when entering a particular state
4. Expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings

The selected sentences provide clear and specific information about the system's behavior, constraints, and requirements, making them suitable as specifications for the Smart RTL mode.
