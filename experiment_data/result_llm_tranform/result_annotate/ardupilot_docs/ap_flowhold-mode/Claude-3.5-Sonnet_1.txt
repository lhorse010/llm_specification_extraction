Let's go through the document step by step and identify the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document carefully.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 3: This describes an expected state change, so it's a specification.
- Sentence 4: This describes an expected post-action, so it's a specification.
- Sentence 7: This introduces parameters that control system behavior, which are constraints, so it's a specification.
- Sentence 8: This describes a constraint (filter applied to sensor data), so it's a specification.
- Sentence 9: This describes a constraint (maximum rate used for stopping), so it's a specification.
- Sentence 10: This describes a constraint (minimum flow quality), so it's a specification.
- Sentence 11: This describes an expected state change based on a condition, so it's a specification.
- Sentence 12: This describes constraints (gains for tuning stopping response), so it's a specification.

Section 1:
No sentences in this section meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 12
        }
    ]
}
```

This output adheres to the required format and includes only the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.
