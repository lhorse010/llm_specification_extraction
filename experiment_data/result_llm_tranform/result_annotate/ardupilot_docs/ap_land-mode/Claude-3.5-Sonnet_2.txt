Thank you for providing the document and instructions. I'll analyze the text and annotate the sentences that qualify as specifications based on the given criteria. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON as per the output format.

Here's the result of the analysis:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected as specifications because they meet the criteria outlined in the objective:

1. They describe requirements for state transitions (e.g., altitude thresholds for descent rates).
2. They outline constraints the system must adhere to (e.g., descent speeds, GPS lock conditions).
3. They detail expected post-actions (e.g., motor shutdown and disarming upon landing).
4. They describe expected state changes in response to specific conditions or settings (e.g., horizontal control behavior with or without GPS lock).

The sentences that were not included either didn't meet these criteria or were too vague to be considered clear specifications.
