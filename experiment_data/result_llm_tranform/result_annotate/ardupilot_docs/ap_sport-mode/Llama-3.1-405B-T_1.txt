After carefully reading the document and following the steps outlined, I have identified the sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of why each sentence was annotated as a specification:

* Section 1, Sentence 0: This sentence states that Sport Mode is not included by default in the firmware, which is a constraint.
* Section 1, Sentence 1: This sentence provides an alternative solution for enabling Sport Mode, which is a constraint.
* Section 2, Sentence 2: This sentence states that the vehicle will not lean more than 45 degrees, which is a constraint.
* Section 2, Sentence 3: This sentence describes the expected post-action of the vehicle when the sticks are placed within 10% of mid-throttle, which is an expected post-action.
* Section 2, Sentence 4: This sentence describes the expected state change of the vehicle when climbing or descending, which is an expected state change.
* Section 2, Sentence 5: This sentence describes the acceleration used to establish the speeds, which is a constraint.

Note that Sentence 0 in Section 0 is not annotated as a specification because it only provides a definition of Sport Mode, which does not convey any information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes. Similarly, Sentences 0 and 1 in Section 2 are not annotated as specifications because they only provide an overview of the mode and do not convey any specific information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes.
