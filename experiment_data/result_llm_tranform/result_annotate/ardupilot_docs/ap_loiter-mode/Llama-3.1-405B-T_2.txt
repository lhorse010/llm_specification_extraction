After carefully reading the document and following the steps outlined, I have annotated the sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        }
    ]
}
```

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 0, Sentence 2: "A good GPS lock, low magnetic interference on the compass and low vibrations are all important in achieving good loiter performance." (constraint)
* Section 1, Sentence 2: "When the pilot releases the sticks the copter will slow to a stop." (expected post-action)
* Section 1, Sentence 5: "The vehicle can be armed in Loiter mode but only once the GPS has 3D lock and the HDOP has dropped below 1.4." (state transition pre-requirement)
* Section 3, Sentence 0: "1.LOIT_SPEED: max horizontal speed in cm/s (i.e. 1250 = 12.5m/s)" (constraint)
* Section 3, Sentence 1: "2.LOIT_ACC_MAX: max acceleration in cm/s/s." (constraint)
* Section 3, Sentence 3: "3.LOIT_ANG_MAX: max lean angle in degrees (i.e. 30deg)." (constraint)
* Section 3, Sentence 5: "4.LOIT_BRK_ACCEL: max acceleration in cm/s/s while braking (i.e. pilot has moved sticks to center)." (constraint)
* Section 3, Sentence 7: "5.LOIT_BRK_DELAY: the delay in seconds before braking starts once the pilot has centered the sticks" (constraint)

Note that I have excluded sentences that are vague or do not convey specific information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes.
