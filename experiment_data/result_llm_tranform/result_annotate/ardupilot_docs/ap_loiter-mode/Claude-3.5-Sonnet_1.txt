Let's go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read through the entire document carefully.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Here are the sentences that qualify as specifications:

1. Section 0, Sentence 0: Describes expected state changes (requirement for state transition).
2. Section 1, Sentence 5: Describes a constraint for arming in Loiter mode.
3. Section 3, Sentence 0: Describes a constraint for maximum horizontal speed.
4. Section 3, Sentence 1: Describes a constraint for maximum acceleration.
5. Section 3, Sentence 3: Describes a constraint for maximum lean angle.
6. Section 3, Sentence 5: Describes a constraint for maximum acceleration while braking.
7. Section 3, Sentence 7: Describes a constraint for braking delay.
8. Section 3, Sentence 8: Describes a constraint for maximum change in acceleration while braking.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        }
    ]
}
```

This output adheres to the required format and includes only the sentences that clearly and specifically describe system requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or state changes related to the Loiter mode functionality.
