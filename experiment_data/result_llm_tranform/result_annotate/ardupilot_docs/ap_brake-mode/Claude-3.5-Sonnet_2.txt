Thank you for providing the document and the task. I'll go through the steps to annotate the sentences that qualify as specifications based on the given criteria.

Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now go through each sentence and determine if it qualifies as a specification based on the categories you've provided.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON as requested.

Here's the analysis and resulting output:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation of the selected specifications:

1. "Once invoked, this mode does not accept any input from the pilot." (section-id: 0, sentence-id: 1)
   - This is an expected state change and constraint.

2. "This mode requires GPS." (section-id: 0, sentence-id: 2)
   - This is a requirement for state transition.

3. "Brake mode is subject to acceleration and angle limits imposed by the position and attitude controllers." (section-id: 0, sentence-id: 3)
   - This is a constraint the system must adhere to.

4. "If the vehicle is landed in Brake mode it will immediately disarm." (section-id: 1, sentence-id: 2)
   - This is an expected post-action when entering a particular state.

5. "The pilots controls are ignored in this mode." (section-id: 2, sentence-id: 0)
   - This is an expected state change and constraint.

6. "The vehicle must be switched out of this mode before the pilot can re-take control." (section-id: 2, sentence-id: 1)
   - This is a requirement for state transition.

These sentences were selected as they clearly specify requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes of the Brake Mode system. Other sentences were excluded as they were either too vague or didn't fit into the specified categories for specifications.
