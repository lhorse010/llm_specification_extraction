Let's go through the steps to annotate the sentences as specifications based on the given criteria:

Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: Let's analyze each sentence and determine if it should be annotated as a specification:

Section 0:
- Sentence 1: Not a specification (general description)
- Sentence 2: Specification (expected state change)
- Sentence 3: Specification (state transition pre-requirement)
- Sentence 4: Specification (constraint)
- Sentence 5: Not a specification (suggestion, not a requirement)
- Sentence 6: Not a specification (example, not a requirement)

Section 1:
- Sentence 0: Not a specification (general description)
- Sentence 1: Not a specification (general information, not a specific requirement)
- Sentence 2: Specification (expected state change)

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Specification (expected state change)
- Sentence 1: Specification (constraint)

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Now, let's present the output in the required format:

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ] 
}
```

This output includes all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. Each specification is represented by its section-id and sentence-id.
