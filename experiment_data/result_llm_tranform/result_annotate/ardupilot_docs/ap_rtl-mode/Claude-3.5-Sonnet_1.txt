Let's go through the document step-by-step and identify the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document about RTL (Return To Launch) mode for a copter.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

After careful analysis, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications:

1. Requirements for state transition:
   - Section 1, Sentence 15: RTL mode requires a reliable position estimate to work properly, most commonly provided by GPS and compass.

2. Constraints the system must adhere to:
   - Section 1, Sentence 3: Under no circumstances will this altitude be below 2m.
   - Section 1, Sentence 14: Again, 2m is the minimum return altitude.

3. Expected post-actions:
   - Section 1, Sentence 1: When RTL mode is selected, the copter will return to the home location, or if rally points have been setup, the closet rally point.
   - Section 1, Sentence 18: RTL will command the copter to return to the home position, meaning that it will return to the location where it was armed.

4. Expected state changes:
   - Section 1, Sentence 1: The copter will first rise a minimum of RTL_CLIMB_MIN or to RTL_ALT, whichever is higher, before returning home.
   - Section 3, Sentence 0: 1.RTL_ALT: The minimum altitude the copter will move to before returning to launch.
   - Section 3, Sentence 4: 2.RTL_ALT_FINAL: The altitude the copter will move to at the final stage of "Returning to Launch" or after completing a Mission.
   - Section 3, Sentence 7: 3.RTL_LOIT_TIME: Time in milliseconds to hover/pause above the "Home" position before beginning final descent.
   - Section 3, Sentence 13: 5.LAND_SPEED: The descent speed for the final stage of landing in centimeters per second.
   - Section 3, Sentence 15: 6.RTL_CLIMB_MIN: The vehicle will climb at least this many meters at the first stage of the RTL.
   - Section 3, Sentence 17: 7.RTL_SPEED: The horizontal speed (in cm/s) at which the vehicle will return to home.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

            "sentence-id": 15
        },

            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {

        },
        {

            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 18
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 17
        }
    ]
}
```

This output adheres to the required format and includes all the sentences that qualify as specifications based on the given criteria.
