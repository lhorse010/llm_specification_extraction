Sentence 3: Constraint
Sentence 4: Constraint
Sentence 5: Expected state change
Sentence 6: Expected state change
Sentence 15: Requirement for state transition

Section 2:
No specifications identified.

Section 3:
Sentence 0: Expected state change

Sentence 19: Expected state change

Section 4:
Sentence 1: Requirement for state transition

This JSON output contains all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the criteria provided. These sentences describe requirements for state transition, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes in the RTL (Return To Launch) mode of the copter system.
