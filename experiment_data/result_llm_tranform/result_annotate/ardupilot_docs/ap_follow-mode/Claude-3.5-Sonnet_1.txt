I'll analyze the document and annotate the sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll determine which sentences convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the analysis:

Sentence 0: This is a general description, not a specification.

Sentence 1: This is a pre-requirement for the Follow mode, so it's a specification.

Sentence 2: This describes an expected state change and post-action, so it's a specification.

Sentence 3: This describes constraints on the system's behavior, so it's a specification.

Sentence 4: This describes how a parameter affects the system's behavior, so it's a specification.

Sentences 5-14: These describe parameters that affect the system's behavior. While they're important, they don't directly describe state transitions, constraints, post-actions, or state changes, so they're not specifications according to our criteria.

Now, I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the OUTPUT FORMAT:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications as per the given instructions. These sentences describe pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes in the Follow Mode system.
