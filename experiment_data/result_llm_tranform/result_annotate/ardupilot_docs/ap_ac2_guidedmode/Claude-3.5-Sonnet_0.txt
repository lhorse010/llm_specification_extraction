I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document about Guided Mode for Copter.

Step 2-4: Identify sentences that meet the criteria and annotate them as specifications.

Here's the output in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 13
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet one or more of the criteria for specifications:

1. Requirements for state transition
2. Constraints the system must adhere to
3. Expected post-actions when entering a particular state
4. Expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings

The selected sentences provide clear and specific information about system behavior, constraints, and expected actions in Guided Mode. Vague or general statements were excluded to meet the requirement of clarity and specificity in specifications.
