Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: Let's analyze each sentence and determine if it should be annotated as a specification:

Section 0:
Sentence 0: This is a general description, not a specification.
Sentence 1: This sentence describes expected state changes and post-actions, so it should be annotated as a specification.

Section 1:
Sentence 0: This sentence describes a state transition pre-requirement and an expected state change, so it should be annotated as a specification.
Sentence 1: This sentence describes an expected post-action, so it should be annotated as a specification.

Step 4: Let's format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes only the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications as per our analysis.
