Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the required information.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.

Step 2: In context, determine whether a sentence conveys information in the following categories: "state transition pre-requirement", "constraint", "expected post-action", "expected state change", or determine whether it conveys no information in any of these categories.

1. Section 0, Sentence 0: This sentence provides general information about the System Identification Mode and does not convey any specific information about state transition, constraints, or expected post-actions. Therefore, it will not be annotated as a specification.

2. Section 0, Sentence 1: This sentence describes the behavior of the system when in System Identification Mode. It can be categorized as an expected post-action, as it describes what the system will do when in this mode. Therefore, it will be annotated as a specification.

3. Section 1, Sentence 0: This sentence describes a condition under which the mode's associated parameters will become visible and entry into the mode will be allowed. It can be categorized as a state transition pre-requirement, as it describes a requirement that must be met for a state transition to occur. Therefore, it will be annotated as a specification.

4. Section 1, Sentence 1: This sentence describes an error message that will be logged and sent if the SID_AXIS is zero. It can be categorized as an expected post-action, as it describes what the system will do in response to a specific condition. Therefore, it will be annotated as a specification.

Step 3: If a sentence is categorized as a pre-requirement, constraint, expected post-action, or expected state change, annotate it as a specification.

Step 4: Format all the annotated sentences in JSON.

OUTPUT:
```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
