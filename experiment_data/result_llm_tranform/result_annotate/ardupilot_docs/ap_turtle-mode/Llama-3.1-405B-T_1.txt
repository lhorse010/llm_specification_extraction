Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

* Sentence 2 in Section 0 is annotated as a specification because it states a requirement for the system to function in Turtle Mode (DShot capable ESCs are required).
* Sentence 3 in Section 0 is annotated as a specification because it states a requirement for the system to function in Turtle Mode (SERVO_DSHOT_ESC must be set to a non-zero value and MOT_PWM_TYPE to a DSHOT value).
* Sentence 8 in Section 0 is annotated as a specification because it states a constraint for entering Turtle Mode (throttle must be zero).
* Sentences 9-12 in Section 0 are annotated as specifications because they describe expected post-actions and state changes when entering and exiting Turtle Mode.
* Sentence 0 in Section 1 is annotated as a specification because it states a constraint for the availability of Turtle Mode (available for multirotors only).

Note that Sentence 1 in Section 1 is not annotated as a specification because it is a warning about potential overheating issues, but it does not convey any specific requirement or constraint for the system.
