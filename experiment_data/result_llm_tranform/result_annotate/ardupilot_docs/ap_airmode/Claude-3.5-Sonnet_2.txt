I will analyze the document and annotate sentences as specifications based on the given criteria. Let's go through this step by step:

Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I will now determine which sentences convey relevant information and should be annotated as specifications.

Section 0:
No sentences in this section qualify as specifications.

Section 1:
Sentence 2: This is an expected state change for ACRO mode.
Sentence 3: This describes a requirement for state transition and an expected state change.
Sentence 4: This is an expected state change.
Sentence 5: This describes a requirement for state transition and an expected state change.
Sentence 6: This describes a requirement for state transition and an expected state change.

Section 2:
Sentence 0: This is a constraint for enabling AIRMODE.
Sentence 1: This is a constraint for Traditional Helicopter.
Sentence 2: This is a requirement for state transition.
Sentence 3: This is a constraint for enabling "airmode".

Step 4: I will now format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the output format.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications, following the required format.
