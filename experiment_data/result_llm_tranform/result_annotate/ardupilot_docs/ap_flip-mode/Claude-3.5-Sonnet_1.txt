I'll go through the document step by step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document carefully.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
Sentence 0: This describes an expected state change, so it's a specification.
Sentence 1: This describes an expected post-action, so it's a specification.
Sentence 2: This describes a constraint, so it's a specification.
Sentence 3: This is a safety recommendation, not a specification.

Section 1:
Sentence 1: This is a requirement for state transition, so it's a specification.
Sentence 2: This describes requirements for state transition, so it's a specification.
Sentence 3: This describes an expected state change, so it's a specification.
Sentence 4: This describes expected post-actions and state changes, so it's a specification.
Sentence 5: This describes requirements for state transition, so it's a specification.
Sentence 7: This describes expected state changes and post-actions, so it's a specification.
Sentence 8: This describes expected state changes and post-actions, so it's a specification.
Sentence 9: This describes expected state changes and post-actions, so it's a specification.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given objectives and requirements.
