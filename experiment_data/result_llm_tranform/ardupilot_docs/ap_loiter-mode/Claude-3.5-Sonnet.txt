    "sentence": "Loiter Mode automatically attempts to maintain the current location, heading and altitude.",
    "formula": "G(L → (M ∧ H ∧ A))",
    "explanation": "This formula states that globally (G), when in Loiter Mode (L), the system maintains (M) location, heading (H), and altitude (A). The continuous nature of this behavior is captured by the global operator."

  {
    "sentence": "The vehicle can be armed in Loiter mode but only once the GPS has 3D lock and the HDOP has dropped below 1.4.",
    "formula": "G(L ∧ G ∧ D → F(A))",
    "explanation": "This formula expresses that globally (G), when in Loiter mode (L) with GPS 3D lock (G) and HDOP below 1.4 (D), it's possible to eventually (F) arm the vehicle (A). The 'can be' is interpreted as a possibility, hence the eventually operator."

    "formula": "G(S ≤ M)",
    "explanation": "This formula states that globally (G), the horizontal speed (S) is always less than or equal to the maximum speed (M). The specific value is not included in the formula but is part of the system's parameters."

    "sentence": "2.LOIT_ACC_MAX: max acceleration in cm/s/s.",

    "formula": "G(Z → (P ∨ A))",
    "explanation": "This formula expresses that globally (G), if the value is zero (Z), then either PSC_ANGLE_MAX (P) or ANGLE_MAX (A) is used. The 'or' operator captures the alternative between the two parameters."

    "formula": "G(C → F[d,d](B))",
    "explanation": "This formula states that globally (G), when the pilot centers the sticks (C), braking (B) will start after exactly d seconds. The timed eventually operator F[d,d] captures the precise delay before braking begins."

    "formula": "G(B → (¬X(A) ∨ (X(A) ∧ (A → P))))",
    "explanation": "This formula represents that globally (G), when braking (B) occurs, the next state's acceleration (X(A)) either doesn't change (¬X(A)) or changes within a predefined limit (P). This captures the concept of maximum jerk during braking."

  {
    "sentence": "Higher numbers will make the vehicle reach the maximum braking angle more quickly, lower numbers will cause smoother braking",
    "formula": "G((H ∧ B) → F[0,t](M)) ∧ G((L ∧ B) → F[0,t'](M))",
    "explanation": "This formula states that globally (G), when higher numbers (H) and braking (B) occur, the maximum braking angle (M) is reached within time t. Conversely, with lower numbers (L), M is reached within time t', where t' > t, representing smoother braking."
