  {
    "sentence": "1.descends to 10m (or until the sonar senses something below the copter) using the regular Altitude Hold controller which will descend at the speed held in the WPNAV_SPEED_DN Copter Pids screen.",
    "formula": "F(A ∨ S) ∧ G(¬(A ∨ S) → D)",
    "explanation": "A represents altitude of 10m, S represents sonar sensing something, and D represents descending at WPNAV_SPEED_DN. The formula ensures that eventually either 10m is reached or sonar senses something, and until then, the copter continues descending at the specified speed."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "2.below 10m the copter should descend at the rate specified in the LAND_SPEED parameter which defaults to 50cm/s.",
    "formula": "G(B → L)",
    "explanation": "B represents being below 10m, and L represents descending at LAND_SPEED. This formula states that globally, whenever the copter is below 10m, it should descend at the LAND_SPEED rate."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "3.Upon reaching the ground the copter will automatically shut-down the motors and disarm the copter if the pilot's throttle is at minimum.",
    "formula": "G(G ∧ T → X(S ∧ D))",
    "explanation": "G represents reaching the ground, T represents throttle at minimum, S represents motor shutdown, and D represents disarming. The formula states that globally, when the ground is reached and throttle is minimum, in the next state, the motors will shut down and the copter will disarm."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "2.If the vehicle has GPS lock the landing controller will attempt to control its horizontal position but the pilot can adjust the target horizontal position just as in Loiter mode.",
    "formula": "G(P → (C ∧ A))",
    "explanation": "P represents GPS lock, C represents horizontal position control, and A represents pilot's ability to adjust. This formula states that globally, when there's a GPS lock, the controller attempts to control horizontal position and the pilot can adjust it."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "3.If the vehicle does not have GPS lock the horizontal control will be as in stabilize mode so the pilot can control the roll and pitch lean angle of the copter.",
    "formula": "G(¬P → S)",
    "explanation": "P represents GPS lock, and S represents stabilize mode control. This formula states that globally, when there's no GPS lock, the copter enters stabilize mode for horizontal control."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Copter will recognise that it has landed if the motors are being commanded to be at low level by the vertical position controller, its climb rate remains between -20cm/s and +20cm/s, and is not accelerating for one second.",
    "formula": "G((M ∧ C ∧ F[1,1](¬A)) → L)",
    "explanation": "M represents motors at low level, C represents climb rate within range, A represents acceleration, and L represents landing recognition. The formula states that globally, if motors are at low level, climb rate is within range, and there's no acceleration for 1 second, then the copter recognizes it has landed."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "It does not use the altitude to decide whether to shut off the motors except that the copter must also be below 10m above the home altitude, unless a rangefinder is being used, in which case it must be within 2m of the ground.",
    "formula": "G((L ∧ (B ∨ (R ∧ W))) → S)",
    "explanation": "L represents landing conditions met, B represents below 10m above home altitude, R represents rangefinder in use, W represents within 2m of ground, and S represents motor shut-off. This complex formula captures the different conditions for motor shut-off based on altitude or rangefinder readings."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "For Traditional Heli, the low motor check in the above landing detection algorithm is replaced with a check that Collective output is below mid-position (controlled by the vertical position controller, ie in descent).",
    "formula": "G(H → (C → L))",
    "explanation": "H represents Traditional Heli, C represents Collective output below mid-position, and L represents landing detection. For Traditional Heli, the landing detection is based on Collective output rather than low motor check."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Using a Weight on Wheels (WoW) switch will increase the descent rate and accelerometer ranges that are acceptable for landing detection.",
    "formula": "G(W → (D ∧ A))",
    "explanation": "W represents WoW switch active, D represents increased descent rate, and A represents increased accelerometer ranges. When WoW switch is used, it allows for wider parameters in landing detection."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "This feature is enabled anytime the LGR_WOW_PIN is not disabled.",
    "formula": "G(¬D → E)",
    "explanation": "D represents LGR_WOW_PIN being disabled, and E represents the feature being enabled. This formula states that globally, whenever the LGR_WOW_PIN is not disabled, the feature is enabled."
