    "sentence": "The buffer is of a limited size (see below) and once it is full, \"SmartRTL deactivated: buffer full\" will appear on the ground stations's HUD and the user will no longer be able to switch into this mode.",
    "formula": "G(F ∧ (M ∧ ¬S))",
    "explanation": "F represents the buffer being full, M represents the message appearing on HUD, and S represents the ability to switch to SmartRTL mode. The formula states that globally, once the buffer is full, the message will appear and switching to SmartRTL will be disabled indefinitely."

  {
    "sentence": "SmartRTL saves points at a maximum of 3 per second, but only if the vehicle has moved at least SRTL_ACCURACY meters from the previous point.",
    "formula": "G(M → (P ∧ X[0,1/3](¬P U M)))",
    "explanation": "M represents the vehicle moving SRTL_ACCURACY meters, and P represents saving a point. The formula ensures that globally, if the vehicle moves the required distance, a point is saved and no points are saved for at least 1/3 second after."

    "formula": "G(C → X(S))",
    "explanation": "C represents the condition of 50 points being saved, and S represents the simplification process. The formula states that globally, when 50 points are saved, in the next state, simplification occurs."

    "formula": "G(A → R)",
    "explanation": "A represents the condition of all intermediate points being within SRTL_ACCURACY, and R represents the replacement with two end points. The formula states that globally, if the accuracy condition is met, the replacement occurs."

    "explanation": "P represents the parameters set to 4 or 5, C represents correct conditions, S represents switching to SmartRTL->RTL, and L represents switching to SmartRTL->Land.

    "sentence": "1.RTL_SPEED can be used to set the speed (in meters/second) at which the vehicle will return to home.",
    "formula": "G(R → S)",
    "explanation": "R represents setting RTL_SPEED, and S represents the vehicle returning at that speed. The formula states that globally, if RTL_SPEED is set, the vehicle will return at that speed."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "By default this parameter is zero meaning the WPNAV_SPEED parameter value will be used.",
    "formula": "G(Z → W)",
    "explanation": "Z represents RTL_SPEED being zero, and W represents using WPNAV_SPEED. The formula states that globally, if RTL_SPEED is zero, WPNAV_SPEED will be used."

    "sentence": "2.RTL_ALT_FINAL if set to 0, will land at home, otherwise will stop and hover above home at this altitude upon completion of the return.",
    "formula": "G(R → (Z → L) ∧ (¬Z → H))",
    "explanation": "R represents RTL_ALT_FINAL being set, Z represents it being zero, L represents landing at home, and H represents hovering at the set altitude. The formula states that globally, when RTL_ALT_FINAL is set, if it's zero, the vehicle will land; otherwise, it will hover at the specified altitude."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "SRTL_ACCURACY controls the accuracy (in meters) of the simplification and pruning performed.",
    "formula": "G(A → (S ∧ P))",
    "explanation": "This formula states that globally (G), when SRTL_ACCURACY is set (A), it implies both simplification (S) and pruning (P) are performed with the specified accuracy. The continuous nature of this control is captured by the global operator."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "SRTL_POINTS controls the maximum number of points that can be stored.",
    "formula": "G(P → X(¬S U C))",
    "explanation": "This formula expresses that globally (G), when SRTL_POINTS is set (P), it implies that in the next state (X), no more points will be stored (¬S) until the capacity is reached (C). This captures the upper limit on storage imposed by SRTL_POINTS."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "SRTL_OPTIONS has one bit, currently, bit 2, that if set (value of \"4\") will ignore pilot yaw commands while in SmartRTL.",
    "formula": "G((O ∧ S) → ¬Y)",
    "explanation": "This formula states that globally (G), when SRTL_OPTIONS is set to 4 (O) and SmartRTL is active (S), it implies that pilot yaw commands (Y) are not processed (¬Y). The global operator ensures this behavior persists throughout the SmartRTL mode."

    "formula": "G(S → F(H))",
    "explanation": "This formula states that globally (G), when SmartRTL is activated (S), it implies that eventually (F) the vehicle will attempt to return home (H). The eventually operator captures the notion of 'attempt to return' without specifying an exact timeframe."

    "formula": "G(¬S → X(C U S))",
    "explanation": "This formula expresses that globally (G), when not in SmartRTL mode (¬S), in the next state (X), the path is continuously captured (C) until (U) SmartRTL is activated (S). This captures the ongoing buffer recording during non-SmartRTL modes."

    "sentence": "The altitude at each point is also stored and used on the return.",
    "formula": "G((C ∧ X(S)) → F(U))",
    "explanation": "This formula states that globally (G), when a point is captured (C) and SmartRTL is activated in the next state (X(S)), it implies that eventually (F) the stored altitude will be used (U). This captures both the storage and subsequent use of altitude data."

  {
    "sentence": "The simplify algorithm will turn curved paths into straight lines but the line should never be more than this distance from the original path.",
    "formula": "G((S ∧ C) → ¬F(D))",
    "explanation": "This formula expresses that globally (G), when simplification occurs (S) on curved paths (C), it implies that it's never the case in the future (¬F) that the distance exceeds the specified limit (D). This ensures the simplified path stays within the accuracy bounds."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The pruning algorithm will cut paths that come within this many meters of each other.",
    "formula": "G((P ∧ N) → X(¬E))",
    "explanation": "This formula states that globally (G), when pruning occurs (P) and paths are near each other (N), it implies that in the next state (X), these path segments no longer exist (¬E). This captures the immediate effect of the pruning algorithm on redundant path segments."

  {
    "sentence": "If the maximum number of points is exhausted, \"SmartRTL deactivated: buffer full\" will be sent to the ground station and the user will not be able to switch into SmartRTL.",

    "explanation": "This formula expresses that globally (G), when the buffer is full (F) and the message is sent (M), it implies that SmartRTL cannot be activated (¬S) until (U) the buffer is reset or cleared (R). This captures the temporary unavailability of SmartRTL when the point limit is reached."
