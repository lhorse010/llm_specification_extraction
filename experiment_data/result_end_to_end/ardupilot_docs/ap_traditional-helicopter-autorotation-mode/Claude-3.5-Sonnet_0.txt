I'll extract the relevant specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(¬power → F(autorotation_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if there's a loss of power, then eventually the autorotation mode should be activated."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(autorotation_mode → F(entry_phase ∧ X(glide_phase ∧ X(flare_phase ∧ X(touch_down_phase)))))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in autorotation mode, the system should eventually enter the entry phase, followed by the glide phase, then the flare phase, and finally the touch-down phase."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(entry_phase → (minimize_head_speed_loss ∧ control_attitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, during the entry phase, the system should minimize head speed loss and control attitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(glide_phase → (manage_head_speed ∧ manage_airspeed))",
            "explanation": "Globally, during the glide phase, the system should manage head speed and airspeed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flare_phase → (reduce_descent_speed ∧ convert_airspeed_to_lift))",
            "explanation": "Globally, during the flare phase, the system should reduce descent speed and convert airspeed into lift."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(touch_down_phase → (manage_collective ∧ maintain_landing_attitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, during the touch-down phase, the system should manage collective and maintain landing attitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(autorotation_mode ∧ power_restored → F(bail_out_phase))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if in autorotation mode and power is restored, then eventually enter the bail-out phase."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(bail_out_phase → F(¬autorotation_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in the bail-out phase, eventually exit the autorotation mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(interlock_disengaged ∧ ¬manual_collective_mode → X(autorotation_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the interlock is disengaged while not in manual collective mode, then in the next state, enter autorotation mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(autorotation_mode ∧ interlock_engaged → X(previous_mode ∨ altitude_hold_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if in autorotation mode and the interlock is engaged, then in the next state, return to the previous mode or altitude hold mode."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications and behaviors of the autonomous autorotation system as described in the document. They cover the mode entry and exit conditions, the sequence of phases during autorotation, and the specific requirements for each phase. The formulas also include the bail-out phase for power restoration scenarios.
