After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet in Loiter mode and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(¬armed → ¬loiter)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle cannot be in Loiter mode unless it is armed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(loiter → gps_lock ∧ hdop < 1.4)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle can only be in Loiter mode if it has a good GPS lock and the HDOP is below 1.4."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(loiter → (horizontal_speed ≤ LOIT_SPEED))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's horizontal speed in Loiter mode is limited by the LOIT_SPEED parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(loiter → (acceleration ≤ LOIT_ACC_MAX))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's acceleration in Loiter mode is limited by the LOIT_ACC_MAX parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(loiter → (lean_angle ≤ LOIT_ANG_MAX))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's lean angle in Loiter mode is limited by the LOIT_ANG_MAX parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(loiter ∧ sticks_centered → F(braking))",
            "explanation": "When the pilot centers the sticks in Loiter mode, the vehicle will eventually start braking."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(loiter ∧ sticks_centered → (braking_acceleration ≤ LOIT_BRK_ACCEL))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's braking acceleration in Loiter mode is limited by the LOIT_BRK_ACCEL parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(loiter ∧ sticks_centered → (braking_jerk ≤ LOIT_BRK_JERK))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's braking jerk in Loiter mode is limited by the LOIT_BRK_JERK parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(loiter → (horizontal_position_error → desired_speed))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's horizontal position error in Loiter mode is converted to a desired speed towards the target position."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(loiter → (desired_speed → desired_acceleration))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's desired speed in Loiter mode is converted to a desired acceleration."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have excluded vague specifications and focused on the clear and specific requirements mentioned in the document. I have also used the MTL operators to express the temporal relationships between the different variables and events in the system.
