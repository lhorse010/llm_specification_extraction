I'll analyze the document and extract the specifications, then express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Finally, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active → F(distance_to_lead ≤ FOLL_DIST_MAX))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active, it should eventually be the case that the distance to the lead vehicle is less than or equal to FOLL_DIST_MAX. This ensures that the vehicle doesn't follow a lead that's too far away."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active → X(maintain_altitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active, in the next state, the vehicle should maintain its altitude. This corresponds to the altitude hold controller requirement."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(|throttle - mid_throttle| < 0.1 → (climb_rate ≤ 2.5 ∧ descent_rate ≤ 2.5))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the throttle is within 10% of mid-throttle, the climb or descent rate should be less than or equal to 2.5 m/s. This represents the specified climb/descent behavior."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active → F(|current_position - (lead_position + offset)| ≤ ε))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active, it should eventually be the case that the current position is within some small distance ε of the lead vehicle's position plus the specified offset. This represents the core following behavior."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(FOLL_YAW_BEHAVE = 0 → yaw = lead_vehicle_yaw)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if FOLL_YAW_BEHAVE is set to 0, the yaw of the following vehicle should match the yaw of the lead vehicle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(FOLL_YAW_BEHAVE = 1 → yaw = atan2(lead_vehicle_y - y, lead_vehicle_x - x))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if FOLL_YAW_BEHAVE is set to 1, the yaw of the following vehicle should always point towards the lead vehicle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active ∧ FOLL_OPTIONS[0] = 1 → gimbal_follows_lead)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active and bit 0 of FOLL_OPTIONS is set to 1, the gimbal should follow the target vehicle."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the provided document. They cover the core following behavior, altitude maintenance, speed limits, yaw behavior, and gimbal control. Some aspects of the document, such as specific parameter names, were not included in the formulas as they are more implementation details rather than behavioral specifications.
