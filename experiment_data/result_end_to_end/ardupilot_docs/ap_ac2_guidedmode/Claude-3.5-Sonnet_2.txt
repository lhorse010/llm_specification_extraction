I've carefully read through the document and extracted the key specifications that can be expressed using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here's the result in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(GuidedMode → F(ReachTarget))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the copter is in Guided Mode, it will eventually reach the target location."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(ReachTarget → X(Hover U NewTarget))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the copter reaches the target, in the next state it will hover until a new target is given."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(TakeOff → F(SafeAltitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, after takeoff, the copter will eventually reach a safe altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(GuidedMode ∧ NoCommand[0,GUID_TIMEOUT] → X(SlowToStop ∨ HoldLevelHover))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if in Guided Mode and no commands are received for GUID_TIMEOUT seconds, in the next state the copter will either slow to a stop or hold a level hover."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(GuidedNoGPS → ¬AcceptPositionTargets ∧ ¬AcceptVelocityTargets)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in Guided_NoGPS mode, the copter does not accept position targets and does not accept velocity targets."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(SpeedControl → (Speed ≤ WPNAV_SPEED ∧ VerticalSpeedUp ≤ WPNAV_SPEED_UP ∧ VerticalSpeedDown ≤ WPNAV_SPEED_DN))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when speed control is active, the horizontal speed is less than or equal to WPNAV_SPEED, vertical speed up is less than or equal to WPNAV_SPEED_UP, and vertical speed down is less than or equal to WPNAV_SPEED_DN."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications for the Guided Mode of the copter as described in the document. They cover aspects such as reaching targets, hovering behavior, altitude requirements, timeout behavior, and speed control. The Guided_NoGPS mode's limitations are also expressed. These formulas provide a formal representation of the system's expected behavior, which can be used for verification and validation purposes in software engineering and quality assurance processes.
