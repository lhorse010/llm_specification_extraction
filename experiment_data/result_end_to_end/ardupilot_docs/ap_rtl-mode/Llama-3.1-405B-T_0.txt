Based on the provided document, I have extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> F(altitude >= RTL_CLIMB_MIN))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter will eventually climb to at least RTL_CLIMB_MIN meters."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> F(altitude >= RTL_ALT))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter will eventually climb to at least RTL_ALT meters."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> altitude >= 2)",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter's altitude will always be at least 2 meters."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> F(distance_to_home <= 0))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter will eventually return to the home location."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> (distance_to_home * RTL_CONE_SLOPE >= altitude))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter's altitude will be limited by the inverted cone defined by RTL_CONE_SLOPE."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> (RTL_LOIT_TIME > 0 -> F(hovering_above_home)))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected and RTL_LOIT_TIME is greater than 0, the copter will eventually hover above the home location for RTL_LOIT_TIME milliseconds."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> (RTL_ALT_FINAL = 0 -> F(landing)))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected and RTL_ALT_FINAL is 0, the copter will eventually land."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> (RTL_SPEED > 0 -> F(horizontal_speed = RTL_SPEED)))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected and RTL_SPEED is greater than 0, the copter's horizontal speed will eventually be set to RTL_SPEED."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> (LAND_SPEED > 0 -> F(descent_speed = LAND_SPEED)))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected and LAND_SPEED is greater than 0, the copter's descent speed will eventually be set to LAND_SPEED."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `RTL_mode`: RTL mode is selected
* `altitude`: the copter's current altitude
* `RTL_CLIMB_MIN`: the minimum altitude the copter will climb to
* `RTL_ALT`: the target altitude for RTL mode
* `distance_to_home`: the distance between the copter's current location and the home location
* `RTL_CONE_SLOPE`: the slope of the inverted cone used to limit the copter's altitude
* `RTL_LOIT_TIME`: the time the copter will hover above the home location
* `hovering_above_home`: the copter is hovering above the home location
* `landing`: the copter is landing
* `RTL_ALT_FINAL`: the final altitude for RTL mode
* `RTL_SPEED`: the horizontal speed for RTL mode
* `LAND_SPEED`: the descent speed for landing
* `horizontal_speed`: the copter's current horizontal speed
* `descent_speed`: the copter's current descent speed
