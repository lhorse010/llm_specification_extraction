I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the converted sentences in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode → F[0,∞](altitude ≥ max(RTL_CLIMB_MIN, RTL_ALT, 2)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when RTL mode is activated, eventually the copter will reach an altitude that is at least the maximum of RTL_CLIMB_MIN, RTL_ALT, and 2 meters."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode ∧ (distance_to_home * RTL_CONE_SLOPE < max(RTL_CLIMB_MIN, RTL_ALT)) → F[0,∞](altitude ≤ max(distance_to_home * RTL_CONE_SLOPE, 2)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when RTL mode is activated and the copter is close to home (determined by RTL_CONE_SLOPE), the maximum altitude will be limited by the cone slope calculation or 2 meters, whichever is higher."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode → F[0,∞](position = home_position))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when RTL mode is activated, eventually the copter will return to the home position."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode ∧ (altitude = home_altitude) → X(hover_time ≥ RTL_LOIT_TIME))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when RTL mode is active and the copter reaches home altitude, it will hover for at least RTL_LOIT_TIME milliseconds before descending."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode → (horizontal_speed ≤ max(RTL_SPEED, WPNAV_SPEED)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when RTL mode is active, the horizontal speed will not exceed the maximum of RTL_SPEED and WPNAV_SPEED."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode ∧ (position = home_position) ∧ (hover_time ≥ RTL_LOIT_TIME) → F[0,∞](altitude = 0))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when RTL mode is active, the copter has reached the home position, and hovered for RTL_LOIT_TIME, it will eventually land (altitude = 0)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode ∧ (altitude ≤ 20 ∧ SONAR_enabled) → altitude = actual_altitude)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when RTL mode is active and the copter is within 20 feet of the ground with SONAR enabled, the altitude will be based on actual altitude rather than pressure altitude."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications for the RTL (Return To Launch) mode as described in the document. They cover aspects such as minimum altitude, cone slope limitations, return to home position, hover time, speed limits, and landing behavior. Note that some details, like specific parameter ranges, are not included in the formulas but are implied in the system's configuration.
