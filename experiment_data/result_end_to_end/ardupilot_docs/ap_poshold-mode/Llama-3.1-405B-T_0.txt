After carefully reading the document, I extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet in PosHold mode. Here are the specifications expressed using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(good_GPS_position ∧ low_magnetic_interference ∧ low_vibrations → maintain_current_location ∧ maintain_current_heading ∧ maintain_current_altitude)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle should always maintain its current location, heading, and altitude when the GPS position is good, magnetic interference is low, and vibrations are low."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(pilot_stick_input → (lean_angle ≤ 45 ∨ lean_angle = ANGLE_MAX))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's lean angle should never exceed 45 degrees or the value set by the ANGLE_MAX parameter when the pilot provides stick input."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(release_stick → F(lean_angle = 0))",
            "explanation": "When the pilot releases the stick, the vehicle should eventually return to a lean angle of 0 degrees."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_stick_input → change_altitude)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's altitude should change when the pilot provides throttle stick input."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(yaw_stick_input → change_heading)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's heading should change when the pilot provides yaw stick input."
        },
        {
            "formula": "¬(arm ∧ ¬(GPS_3D_lock ∧ HDOP ≤ 2.0))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle should not arm unless the GPS has a 3D lock and the HDOP value is 2.0 or lower."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(PHLD_BRAKE_ANGLE_set → (brake_angle ≤ PHLD_BRAKE_ANGLE))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's brake angle should never exceed the value set by the PHLD_BRAKE_ANGLE parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(PHLD_BRAKE_RATE_set → (brake_rate = PHLD_BRAKE_RATE))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's brake rate should be equal to the value set by the PHLD_BRAKE_RATE parameter."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I excluded vague specifications and focused on clear and specific requirements. I also used the logical operators and temporal modal operators as specified in the problem statement.
