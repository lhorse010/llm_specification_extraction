I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold → (F[0,ε](maintain_location ∧ maintain_heading ∧ maintain_altitude)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when PosHold mode is activated, the vehicle will eventually (within a small time ε) maintain its current location, heading, and altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold ∧ stick_input ≠ 0 → F[0,δ](lean_angle ≤ 45))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in PosHold mode and there's a non-zero stick input, the vehicle's lean angle will eventually (within time δ) be less than or equal to 45 degrees (default maximum)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold ∧ stick_input = 0 → F[0,γ](lean_back ∧ vehicle_stop))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in PosHold mode and stick input returns to zero, the vehicle will eventually (within time γ) lean back and come to a stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold → (throttle_stick → altitude_control))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in PosHold mode, throttle stick input controls the altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold → (yaw_stick → heading_control))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in PosHold mode, yaw stick input controls the heading."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(arm_request ∧ mode = PosHold → (GPS_lock = 3D ∧ HDOP ≤ 2.0))",
            "explanation": "Globally, arming in PosHold mode is only allowed when GPS has 3D lock and HDOP is less than or equal to 2.0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold → brake_angle ≤ PHLD_BRAKE_ANGLE)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in PosHold mode, the maximum brake angle is limited by the PHLD_BRAKE_ANGLE parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold → brake_rate = PHLD_BRAKE_RATE)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in PosHold mode, the rate at which the vehicle rotates back to the maximum angle is set by the PHLD_BRAKE_RATE parameter."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications of the PosHold mode as described in the document. They cover the mode's behavior, control inputs, arming conditions, and configurable parameters. The formulas use the temporal operators G (globally) and F (finally) to express the temporal aspects of the specifications.
