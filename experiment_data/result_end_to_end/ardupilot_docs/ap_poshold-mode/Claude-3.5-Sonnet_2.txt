Let's go through the steps to extract specifications and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

Step 1: I have thoroughly read the document about PosHold mode.

Step 4: Let's extract specifications and express them using MTL formulas.

Step 5: Here's the formatted output in JSON:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold → (F[0,ε](maintain_location ∧ maintain_heading ∧ maintain_altitude)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when PosHold mode is activated, it should eventually (within a small time ε) maintain the current location, heading, and altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold → (good_GPS ∧ low_magnetic_interference ∧ low_vibrations))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in PosHold mode, the system should have good GPS, low magnetic interference, and low vibrations for optimal performance."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold ∧ stick_input ≠ 0 → F[0,δ](lean_angle ≤ 45°))",
            "explanation": "Globally, in PosHold mode, when there's stick input, the lean angle should eventually (within time δ) be less than or equal to 45 degrees (default maximum)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold ∧ stick_input = 0 → F[0,γ](velocity = 0))",
            "explanation": "Globally, in PosHold mode, when stick input is released, the vehicle should eventually (within time γ) come to a stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold → (throttle_control → altitude_change))",
            "explanation": "Globally, in PosHold mode, throttle control should affect altitude change."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold → (yaw_control → heading_change))",
            "explanation": "Globally, in PosHold mode, yaw control should affect heading change."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(arm_request ∧ mode = PosHold → (GPS_3D_lock ∧ HDOP ≤ 2.0))",
            "explanation": "Globally, arming in PosHold mode requires GPS 3D lock and HDOP less than or equal to 2.0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold → (brake_angle ≤ PHLD_BRAKE_ANGLE))",
            "explanation": "Globally, in PosHold mode, the brake angle should not exceed the value set by PHLD_BRAKE_ANGLE parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = PosHold → (rotation_rate ≤ PHLD_BRAKE_RATE))",
            "explanation": "Globally, in PosHold mode, the rotation rate back to maximum angle should not exceed the value set by PHLD_BRAKE_RATE parameter."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications of the PosHold mode as described in the document. They cover aspects such as maintaining position, altitude, and heading, control inputs, arming conditions, and parameter-controlled behaviors. The formulas use the globally (G) operator to indicate that these specifications should hold at all times when the PosHold mode is active.
