Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (WPNAV_SPEED > 0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's speed should always be greater than 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (WPNAV_ACCEL_C > 0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's corner lateral acceleration limit should always be greater than 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (HDOP < 2.0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's HDOP should always be less than 2.0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (vibration levels < acceptable levels))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's vibration levels should always be less than acceptable levels."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (compass interference levels < acceptable levels))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's compass interference levels should always be less than acceptable levels."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> F (RTL or LAND))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter should eventually execute an RTL or LAND command."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (WPNAV_RADIUS > 0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's WPNAV_RADIUS should always be greater than 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (WPNAV_SPEED_UP > 0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's WPNAV_SPEED_UP should always be greater than 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (WPNAV_SPEED_DN > 0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's WPNAV_SPEED_DN should always be greater than 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (WPNAV_ACCEL_Z > 0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's WPNAV_ACCEL_Z should always be greater than 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (WPNAV_ACCEL > 0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's WPNAV_ACCEL should always be greater than 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (WPNAV_JERK > 0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's WPNAV_JERK should always be greater than 0."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that some of the specifications are not directly quantifiable, such as "acceptable levels" of vibration and compass interference. These would need to be defined more precisely in order to be expressed as MTL formulas. Additionally, some specifications may be missing from this list, as they may not be explicitly stated in the provided document.
