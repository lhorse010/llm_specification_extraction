Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (WPNAV_SPEED > 0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's speed should always be greater than 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (WPNAV_ACCEL_C > 0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's corner lateral acceleration limit should always be greater than 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (HDOP < 2.0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's HDOP should always be less than 2.0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (vibration levels < acceptable levels))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's vibration levels should always be less than acceptable levels."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (compass interference levels < acceptable levels))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's compass interference levels should always be less than acceptable levels."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> F (RTL or LAND))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter should eventually execute an RTL or LAND command."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (WPNAV_RADIUS > 0))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's WPNAV_RADIUS should always be greater than 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (Speed < WPNAV_SPEED))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's speed should always be less than or equal to WPNAV_SPEED."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (vertical speed < WPNAV_SPEED_UP or WPNAV_SPEED_DN))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's vertical speed should always be less than or equal to WPNAV_SPEED_UP or WPNAV_SPEED_DN."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (AutoMode -> (yaw control = autopilot or pilot))",
            "explanation": "In Auto mode, the copter's yaw control should always be controlled by either the autopilot or the pilot."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that some of the specifications are not directly quantifiable, so I've used qualitative descriptions instead. Additionally, some specifications may require additional context or assumptions to be formalized accurately. These MTL formulas are intended to provide a starting point for further refinement and analysis.
