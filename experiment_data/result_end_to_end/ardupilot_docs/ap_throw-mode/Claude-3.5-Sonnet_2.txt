I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the converted sentences in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(armed ∧ throw_mode → ¬pilot_input)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the vehicle is armed and in throw mode, it does not accept any input from the pilot."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode → gps_available)",
            "explanation": "Globally, throw mode requires GPS to be available."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode ∧ ¬armed → F(armed ∧ X(vertical_velocity > 0.5 ∧ total_velocity > 5 → F(motors_start))))",
            "explanation": "Globally, in throw mode, if the vehicle is not armed, then eventually it will be armed, and in the next state, if vertical velocity exceeds 0.5 m/s and total velocity exceeds 5 m/s, the motors will eventually start."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(motors_start → F(attitude_control ∧ F(stop_descending ∧ F(stop_horizontal))))",
            "explanation": "Globally, after motors start, the vehicle will eventually control its attitude, then eventually stop descending, and finally attempt to stop moving horizontally."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode ∧ armed → altitude > THROW_ALT_MIN ∧ altitude < THROW_ALT_MAX)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in throw mode and armed, the altitude must be above THROW_ALT_MIN and below THROW_ALT_MAX."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode ∧ THROW_TYPE = 0 → F(vertical_velocity > 0))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in throw mode with THROW_TYPE set to 0, the vehicle must eventually have a positive vertical velocity (thrown upwards)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode ∧ THROW_TYPE = 1 → altitude > 10)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in throw mode with THROW_TYPE set to 1 (dropping), the initial altitude must be greater than 10 meters."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode ∧ THROW_MOT_START = 0 → motors_stopped)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in throw mode with THROW_MOT_START set to 0, the motors should be stopped while waiting for the throw."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode ∧ THROW_MOT_START = 1 → motors_spinning_slowly)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in throw mode with THROW_MOT_START set to 1, the motors should be spinning slowly while waiting for the throw."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode ∧ vehicle_stopped → F(flight_mode = THROW_NEXTMODE))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in throw mode and the vehicle has stopped, it will eventually switch to the flight mode specified by THROW_NEXTMODE."
        }
    ]
}

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the provided document about the Throw Mode for the vehicle. They express the conditions for arming, motor start, velocity requirements, altitude limits, and mode transitions. The formulas use the temporal operators to express the sequence of events and the global constraints that must be maintained throughout the operation of the vehicle in Throw Mode.
