    "index": 0,
    "formula": "G(altitude > 10m → descent_rate = WPNAV_SPEED_DN)",
    "explanation": "The copter descends at the speed held in the WPNAV_SPEED_DN parameter when above 10m altitude."

    "index": 1,

  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(altitude = 0 ∧ throttle = 0 → X(motors_off ∧ disarmed))",
    "explanation": "Upon reaching the ground, the copter will automatically shut-down the motors and disarm if the pilot's throttle is at minimum."
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G(GPS_lock → controlled_horizontal_position)",
    "explanation": "If the vehicle has GPS lock, the landing controller will attempt to control its horizontal position."
  },
  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(¬GPS_lock → stabilize_mode)",
    "explanation": "If the vehicle does not have GPS lock, the horizontal control will be as in stabilize mode."

    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G(landed → (motors_low ∧ climb_rate ∈ [-20cm/s, 20cm/s] ∧ ¬accelerating))",
    "explanation": "The copter recognizes that it has landed if the motors are being commanded to be at low level, its climb rate remains between -20cm/s and +20cm/s, and is not accelerating for one second."
  },
  {
    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G(altitude < 10m ∨ rangefinder_distance < 2m → motors_off)",
    "explanation": "The copter must be below 10m above the home altitude or within 2m of the ground (if using a rangefinder) to shut off the motors."

    "formula": "G(Weight_on_Wheels → increased_descent_rate ∧ increased_accelerometer_ranges)",
    "explanation": "Using a Weight on Wheels (WoW) switch will increase the descent rate and accelerometer ranges that are acceptable for landing detection."
