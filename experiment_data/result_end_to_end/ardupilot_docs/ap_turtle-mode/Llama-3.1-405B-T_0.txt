After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required output format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle = 0 → ¬turtle_mode)",
            "explanation": "Turtle mode cannot be entered unless throttle is zero."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(turtle_mode → (motors_disarmed ∧ notify_LEDs_flash)) U (throttle > 0)",
            "explanation": "Upon entry to turtle mode, the motors stay disarmed, but the notify LEDs flash until throttle is raised."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(turtle_mode ∧ throttle > 0 → (motors_armed ∧ motors_spin))",
            "explanation": "Raising the throttle in turtle mode arms the motors and makes them spin."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(turtle_mode ∧ throttle = 0 → motors_disarmed)",
            "explanation": "Lowering throttle to zero in turtle mode disarms the motors."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(motors_spin → throttle > 0)",
            "explanation": "Motors spin only when throttle is raised."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(turtle_mode → F(¬turtle_mode))",
            "explanation": "Turtle mode is temporary and will be exited eventually."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(SERVO_DSHOT_ESC ≠ 0 ∧ MOT_PWM_TYPE = DSHOT → turtle_mode_enabled)",
            "explanation": "Turtle mode requires DShot capable ESCs and specific settings."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have excluded vague specifications and focused on clear and specific requirements. I have also used the MTL operators to express the temporal relationships between events and states.
