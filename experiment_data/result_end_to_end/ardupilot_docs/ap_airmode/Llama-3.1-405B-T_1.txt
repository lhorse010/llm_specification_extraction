Based on the provided document, I will extract the specifications and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

Here are the extracted specifications:

1. If arming is setup via the rudder stick and throttle is lowered to idle in ACRO mode, the stabilization is removed.

MTL Formula: G((arming_setup_via_rudder_stick ∧ throttle_idle) → ¬stabilization_active)

Explanation: This formula states that globally, if arming is setup via the rudder stick and the throttle is idle, then stabilization is not active.

2. If a transmitter switch is used with RCx_OPTION ARM/DISARM with Airmode (option 154) and used to arm, then stabilization at idle throttle is still fully active.

MTL Formula: G((transmitter_switch_used ∧ RCx_OPTION_ARM_DISARM_with_Airmode ∧ arming_via_switch) → stabilization_active)

Explanation: This formula states that globally, if a transmitter switch is used with RCx_OPTION ARM/DISARM with Airmode and used to arm, then stabilization is active.

3. Setting an RC channel to RCx_OPTION = 84 allows enabling or disabling AIRMODE in ACRO and STABILIZE modes directly.

MTL Formula: G(RCx_OPTION = 84 → (AIRMODE_enabled ∨ AIRMODE_disabled))

Explanation: This formula states that globally, if an RC channel is set to RCx_OPTION = 84, then AIRMODE is either enabled or disabled.

4. Setting bit 0 of ACRO_OPTIONS will activate AIRMODE in ACRO mode (only) all the time, except if overridden by the above switch, if used.

MTL Formula: G((ACRO_OPTIONS_bit_0_set ∧ ¬overridden_by_switch) → AIRMODE_enabled)

Explanation: This formula states that globally, if bit 0 of ACRO_OPTIONS is set and not overridden by the switch, then AIRMODE is enabled.

5. AIRMODE has no effect in Traditional Helicopter mode.

MTL Formula: G(in_Traditional_Helicopter_mode → ¬AIRMODE_enabled)

Explanation: This formula states that globally, if the system is in Traditional Helicopter mode, then AIRMODE is not enabled.

Here are the specifications in JSON format:
