Based on the provided document, I will extract the specifications and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

Here are the extracted specifications:

1. If arming is setup via the rudder stick and throttle is lowered to idle in ACRO mode, the stabilization is removed.
2. If a transmitter switch is used with RCx_OPTION ARM/DISARM with Airmode (option 154) and used to arm, then stabilization at idle throttle is still fully active.
3. AIRMODE can be set to be active without using the RCx_OPTION switch to arm by setting an RC channel to RCx_OPTION = 84.
4. Setting bit 0 of ACRO_OPTIONS will activate AIRMODE in ACRO mode (only) all the time, except if overridden by the above switch, if used.
5. AIRMODE has no effect in Traditional Helicopter.
6. It isn't sufficient to just enable arming on an RCx_OPTION switch, you also have to actually use it for arming.

Here are the MTL formulas for the extracted specifications:

Note that I used the following predicates:

* `arming_setup_via_rudder_stick`: Arming is setup via the rudder stick.
* `throttle_idle_in_acro_mode`: Throttle is lowered to idle in ACRO mode.
* `stabilization_active`: Stabilization is active.
* `rcx_option_arm_disarm_with_airmode`: RCx_OPTION ARM/DISARM with Airmode (option 154) is used.
* `arm_via_rcx_option_switch`: Arming is done via the RCx_OPTION switch.
* `stabilization_active_at_idle_throttle`: Stabilization is active at idle throttle.
* `rcx_option_84`: RC channel is set to RCx_OPTION = 84.
* `airmode_active`: AIRMODE is active.
* `acrob_options_bit_0`: Bit 0 of ACRO_OPTIONS is set.
* `overridden_by_rcx_option_switch`: Overridden by the RCx_OPTION switch.
* `airmode_active_in_acro_mode`: AIRMODE is active in ACRO mode.
* `traditional_helicopter`: Traditional Helicopter is used.
* `rcx_option_switch_enabled`: RCx_OPTION switch is enabled.
* `arm_via_rcx_option_switch`: Arming is done via the RCx_OPTION switch.
