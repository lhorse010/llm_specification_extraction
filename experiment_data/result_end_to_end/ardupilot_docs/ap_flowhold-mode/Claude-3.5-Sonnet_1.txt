I've read through the document and extracted the relevant specifications. I'll now express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas and provide explanations.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(¬GPS ∧ ¬Lidar → FlowHold)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if there's no GPS and no Lidar, then FlowHold mode should be used. This captures the primary purpose of FlowHold mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(FlowHold → (OpticalFlowSensor ∧ HeightEstimation ∧ SpeedEstimation))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in FlowHold mode, the system must use an optical flow sensor for height estimation and speed estimation. This reflects the core functionality of FlowHold mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(StickRelease → F(VehicleStop))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the user releases the control sticks, the vehicle should eventually come to a stop. This captures the behavior of the autopilot using the optical flow sensor to stop the vehicle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(HeightChange → X(Wobble U StableHeight))",
            "explanation": "Globally, after a significant height change, the vehicle may wobble in the next state until a stable height is achieved. This represents the learning process after takeoff or large height changes."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(FlowQuality < FHLD_QUAL_MIN → AltHold)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the flow sensor quality falls below FHLD_QUAL_MIN, the system should switch to AltHold mode. This captures the fallback behavior when flow quality is insufficient."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(FlowHold → (OpticalFlowRate ≤ FHLD_FLOW_MAX))",
            "explanation": "Globally, in FlowHold mode, the optical flow sensor's rate should not exceed FHLD_FLOW_MAX. This ensures the sensor operates within its specified limits."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications of the FlowHold mode as described in the document. They cover the mode's primary purpose, its core functionalities, behavior patterns, and operational constraints. The formulas use the provided logical and temporal modal operators to express these specifications in a formal, verifiable manner.
