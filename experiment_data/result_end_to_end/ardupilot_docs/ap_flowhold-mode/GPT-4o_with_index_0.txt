    "explanation": "If the optical flow sensor quality is above the minimum threshold, the vehicle should not wobble and must maintain a stable position hold."

    "formula": "G (user_releases_sticks → F (vehicle_stops))",
    "explanation": "When the user releases the sticks, the vehicle should eventually come to a stop."

    "formula": "G (takeoff ∨ height_change → F (¬wobble))",
    "explanation": "After takeoff or a significant change in height, the vehicle should eventually stop wobbling as it stabilizes."
