After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet in FlowHold mode. Here are the specifications expressed using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(release_sticks → F(stop_vehicle))",
            "explanation": "When the user releases the sticks, the vehicle will eventually come to a stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(learn_height → F(stable_height))",
            "explanation": "After learning the new height, the vehicle will eventually stabilize its height."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(learn_velocity → F(stable_velocity))",
            "explanation": "After learning the new velocity, the vehicle will eventually stabilize its velocity."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flow_quality ≥ FHLD_QUAL_MIN → FlowHold_mode)",
            "explanation": "If the flow sensor quality is above the minimum threshold, the vehicle will operate in FlowHold mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flow_quality < FHLD_QUAL_MIN → AltHold_mode)",
            "explanation": "If the flow sensor quality falls below the minimum threshold, the vehicle will switch to AltHold mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(FHLD_BRAKE_RATE > 0 → decelerate_vehicle)",
            "explanation": "If the brake rate is positive, the vehicle will decelerate when the pilot releases the sticks."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(FHLD_FLOW_MAX > 0 → bounded_stopping_rate)",
            "explanation": "If the maximum flow rate is positive, the vehicle's stopping rate will be bounded."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have excluded vague specifications and focused on clear and specific requirements. I have also used the logical and temporal operators of MTL to express the specifications in a formal and concise manner.
