Based on the provided document, I will extract the specifications and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

Here are the extracted specifications:

1. The System Identification Mode is enabled only when SID_AXIS is non-zero.
2. When the System Identification Mode is enabled, its associated parameters become visible on the next parameter refresh.
3. When the System Identification Mode is enabled, entry into the mode is allowed.
4. If SID_AXIS is zero, an error message is logged and sent to the ground control station indicating that mode entry has been prohibited.

Here are the MTL formulas for the extracted specifications:

1. G(SID_AXIS ≠ 0 → X(System Identification Mode enabled))
   Explanation: Globally, if SID_AXIS is non-zero, then the System Identification Mode is enabled at the next time step.

2. G(System Identification Mode enabled → X(associated parameters visible))
   Explanation: Globally, if the System Identification Mode is enabled, then its associated parameters become visible at the next time step.

3. G(System Identification Mode enabled → F(entry into mode allowed))
   Explanation: Globally, if the System Identification Mode is enabled, then entry into the mode is allowed at some future time step.

4. G(SID_AXIS = 0 → F(error message logged and sent))
   Explanation: Globally, if SID_AXIS is zero, then an error message is logged and sent to the ground control station at some future time step.

Here are the MTL formulas in JSON format:
