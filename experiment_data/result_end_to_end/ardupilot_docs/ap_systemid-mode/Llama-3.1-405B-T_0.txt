Based on the provided document, I will extract the specifications and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

Here are the extracted specifications:

1. The System Identification Mode will be enabled if the SID_AXIS is non-zero.
2. If the SID_AXIS is zero, an error message will be logged and sent to the ground control station.
3. When the System Identification Mode is enabled, the vehicle will enter a STABILIZE like mode.
4. In the System Identification Mode, bursts of signals ("chirps") will be injected into the control loops at various points.
5. The results of the signal injections will be logged for math analysis and model generation later.

Here are the MTL formulas for the extracted specifications:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(SID_AXIS ≠ 0 → X(System_Identification_Mode = enabled))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if SID_AXIS is non-zero, then the System Identification Mode will be enabled at the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(SID_AXIS = 0 → X(Error_Message = logged))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if SID_AXIS is zero, then an error message will be logged at the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(System_Identification_Mode = enabled → X(Vehicle_Mode = STABILIZE))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the System Identification Mode is enabled, the vehicle will enter a STABILIZE like mode at the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(System_Identification_Mode = enabled → F(Signal_Injection = started))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the System Identification Mode is enabled, bursts of signals will eventually be injected into the control loops."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Signal_Injection = started → F(Logging = started))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the signal injection starts, the logging of results will eventually start."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `SID_AXIS`: the value of the SID_AXIS parameter
* `System_Identification_Mode`: the status of the System Identification Mode (enabled or disabled)
* `Error_Message`: the status of the error message (logged or not logged)
* `Vehicle_Mode`: the mode of the vehicle (STABILIZE or not STABILIZE)
* `Signal_Injection`: the status of the signal injection (started or not started)
* `Logging`: the status of the logging (started or not started)
