  {
    "index": 0,
    "formula": "G(manual_input → X(roll_pitch_level))",
    "explanation": "Globally, if there's a manual input, in the next state the roll and pitch will be leveled. This corresponds to the self-leveling behavior of Stabilize mode."
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G(¬pilot_input → maintain_heading)",
    "explanation": "Globally, when there's no pilot input, the vehicle maintains its current heading. This represents the yaw behavior in Stabilize mode."
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(throttle_down → motors_min_rate)",
    "explanation": "Globally, when the throttle is completely down, the motors will go to their minimum rate (MOT_SPIN_ARMED)."
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G(tilt_angle_increase → throttle_increase)",
    "explanation": "Globally, as the tilt angle of the vehicle increases, the throttle sent to the motors is automatically increased. This represents the automatic throttle adjustment based on tilt angle."
  },
  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(lean_angle ≤ ANGLE_MAX)",
    "explanation": "Globally, the lean angle of the vehicle is always less than or equal to ANGLE_MAX (45 degrees by default)."
  },
  {
    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G(rotation_rate ≤ ANGLE_RATE_MAX)",
    "explanation": "Globally, the requested rotation rate in roll and pitch axis is always less than or equal to ANGLE_RATE_MAX (180 deg/sec by default)."
  },
  {
    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G(yaw_input_max → rotation_rate = ACRO_Y_RATE)",
    "explanation": "Globally, when maximum yaw input is given, the rotation rate equals ACRO_Y_RATE (200 deg/sec by default)."
