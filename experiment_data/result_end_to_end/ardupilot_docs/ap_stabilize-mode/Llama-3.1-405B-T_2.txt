After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet in Stabilize Mode. Here are the specifications expressed using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(pilot_roll_input → X(lean_angle_control))",
            "explanation": "The pilot's roll input always controls the lean angle of the copter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(pilot_pitch_input → X(lean_angle_control))",
            "explanation": "The pilot's pitch input always controls the lean angle of the copter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(release_roll_stick → X(automatic_leveling))",
            "explanation": "When the pilot releases the roll stick, the vehicle automatically levels itself."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(release_pitch_stick → X(automatic_leveling))",
            "explanation": "When the pilot releases the pitch stick, the vehicle automatically levels itself."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(pilot_yaw_input → X(rate_of_change_heading))",
            "explanation": "The pilot's yaw input always controls the rate of change of the heading."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(release_yaw_stick → X(maintain_current_heading))",
            "explanation": "When the pilot releases the yaw stick, the vehicle maintains its current heading."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_input → X(average_motor_speed))",
            "explanation": "The pilot's throttle input always controls the average motor speed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_down → X(motors_minimum_rate))",
            "explanation": "When the pilot puts the throttle completely down, the motors go to their minimum rate."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(airmode_enabled → X(full_stabilization_idle_throttle))",
            "explanation": "When airmode is enabled, the vehicle provides full stabilization at idle throttle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(ANGLE_MAX → X(max_lean_angle))",
            "explanation": "The maximum lean angle is always limited to the value of ANGLE_MAX."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(ANGLE_RATE_MAX → X(max_rotation_rate))",
            "explanation": "The maximum requested rotation rate in the roll and pitch axis is always limited to the value of ANGLE_RATE_MAX."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(ACRO_Y_RATE → X(rotation_rate))",
            "explanation": "The rate of rotation based on the pilot's yaw input is always controlled by the value of ACRO_Y_RATE."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have excluded vague specifications and focused on clear and specific requirements. I have also used the logical operators and temporal modal operators as specified in the problem statement.
