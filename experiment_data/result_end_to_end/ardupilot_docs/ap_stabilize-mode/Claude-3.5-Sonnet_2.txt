I'll go through the document and extract the relevant specifications, then express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(¬GPS → ¬ARM)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if there is no GPS (reliable position estimate), then the vehicle should not be armed. This addresses the warning about needing a reliable position estimate before arming."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((ROLL_INPUT = 0 ∧ PITCH_INPUT = 0) → F(LEVEL = TRUE))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when roll and pitch inputs are zero, the vehicle will eventually level itself. This captures the self-leveling behavior of Stabilize mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(YAW_INPUT = 0 → X(HEADING = CURRENT_HEADING))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when yaw input is zero, in the next state the heading will be maintained at the current heading. This represents the yaw behavior in Stabilize mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(THROTTLE = 0 → MOTOR_SPEED = MOT_SPIN_ARMED)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when throttle is zero, motor speed will be set to MOT_SPIN_ARMED (minimum rate). This captures the throttle behavior at minimum input."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(TILT_ANGLE > 0 → THROTTLE_ADJUSTMENT > 0)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the tilt angle is greater than zero, there will be a positive throttle adjustment. This represents the automatic throttle adjustment based on tilt angle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(LEAN_ANGLE ≤ ANGLE_MAX)",
            "explanation": "Globally, the lean angle should always be less than or equal to ANGLE_MAX. This enforces the maximum lean angle parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(ROTATION_RATE ≤ ANGLE_RATE_MAX)",
            "explanation": "Globally, the rotation rate should always be less than or equal to ANGLE_RATE_MAX. This enforces the maximum rotation rate parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(|YAW_RATE| ≤ ACRO_Y_RATE)",
            "explanation": "Globally, the absolute value of the yaw rate should be less than or equal to ACRO_Y_RATE. This enforces the maximum yaw rate based on the ACRO_Y_RATE parameter."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the provided document, focusing on the behavior of the Stabilize mode and important parameters. The formulas use the temporal operators and logical connectives to express the relationships between inputs, states, and outputs of the system over time.
