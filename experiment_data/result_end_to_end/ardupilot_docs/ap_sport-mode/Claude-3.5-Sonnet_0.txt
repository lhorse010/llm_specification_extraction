I'll go through the steps to extract and express the specifications using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the document about Sport Mode in detail.

Step 4: Extract specifications and express them using metric temporal logic formula.
I'll extract the clear and specific specifications and express them using MTL formulas.

Step 5: Format all the converted sentences in JSON.

Here's the output in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(roll_angle ≤ 45 ∧ roll_angle ≥ -45)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will not lean more than 45 degrees in roll. This is expressed as 'Globally, the roll angle is less than or equal to 45 degrees and greater than or equal to -45 degrees.'"
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(pitch_angle ≤ 45 ∧ pitch_angle ≥ -45)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will not lean more than 45 degrees in pitch. This is expressed as 'Globally, the pitch angle is less than or equal to 45 degrees and greater than or equal to -45 degrees.'"
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((|throttle - mid_throttle| ≤ 10%) → X(altitude = current_altitude))",
            "explanation": "When the throttle is within 10% of mid-throttle, the vehicle will attempt to hold its current altitude. This is expressed as 'Globally, if the absolute difference between throttle and mid-throttle is less than or equal to 10%, then in the next state, the altitude will be equal to the current altitude.'"
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(vertical_speed ≤ 2.5 ∧ vertical_speed ≥ -2.5)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will climb or descend at up to 2.5m/s. This is expressed as 'Globally, the vertical speed is less than or equal to 2.5 m/s and greater than or equal to -2.5 m/s.'"
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((stick_released) → X(attitude = current_attitude))",
            "explanation": "When the sticks are released, the vehicle will remain in its current attitude. This is expressed as 'Globally, if the stick is released, then in the next state, the attitude will be equal to the current attitude.'"
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications of the Sport Mode as described in the document. Note that some aspects of the system's behavior, such as the pilot's control of rotation rates, are not easily expressed in MTL and have been omitted. The formulas focus on the quantifiable and verifiable aspects of the system's behavior.
