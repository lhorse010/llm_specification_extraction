Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(|roll| ≤ 45 ∧ |pitch| ≤ 45)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will not lean more than 45 degrees in roll and pitch."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(sticks_released → X(vehicle_attitude = current_attitude))",
            "explanation": "When the sticks are released, the vehicle will remain in its current attitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((throttle ∈ [0.4, 0.6]) → X(altitude = current_altitude))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will attempt to hold its current altitude when the sticks are placed within 10% of mid-throttle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(climbing → G(altitude_change_rate ≤ 2.5))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will climb at a speed of up to 2.5m/s."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(descending → G(altitude_change_rate ≥ -2.5))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will descend at a speed of up to 2.5m/s."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(acceleration = PILOT_ACCEL_Z)",
            "explanation": "The acceleration used to establish the climb and descent speeds is set by PILOT_ACCEL_Z."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I've used the following assumptions and simplifications:

* `roll` and `pitch` represent the vehicle's roll and pitch angles, respectively.
* `sticks_released` is a predicate indicating that the pilot's sticks are released.
* `vehicle_attitude` represents the vehicle's current attitude.
* `throttle` represents the current throttle value, normalized to the range [0, 1].
* `altitude` represents the vehicle's current altitude.
* `altitude_change_rate` represents the rate of change of the vehicle's altitude.
* `PILOT_ACCEL_Z` is a constant representing the acceleration used to establish the climb and descent speeds.
* `climbing` and `descending` are predicates indicating that the vehicle is climbing or descending, respectively.
