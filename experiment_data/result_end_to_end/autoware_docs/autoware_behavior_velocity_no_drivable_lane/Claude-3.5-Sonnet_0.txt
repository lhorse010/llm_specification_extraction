I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas as requested. Then, I'll format the output in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(no_drivable_lane → F(stopped ∧ takeover_request))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a no drivable lane is encountered, the vehicle must eventually stop and issue a takeover request."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(approaching_no_drivable_lane → X(¬inside_no_drivable_lane U stopped))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when approaching a no drivable lane, the vehicle must not enter the no drivable lane until it has stopped."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(inside_no_drivable_lane → X(stopped))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is inside a no drivable lane, it must stop in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(distance_to_no_drivable_lane ≤ stop_margin → X(stopped))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the distance to the no drivable lane is less than or equal to the stop margin, the vehicle must stop in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(autonomous_mode_start ∧ inside_no_drivable_lane → X(stopped))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if autonomous mode is started while inside a no drivable lane, the vehicle must stop in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(no_drivable_lane_attribute = yes → F(stopped ∨ ¬autonomous_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a lane has the no_drivable_lane attribute set to 'yes', the vehicle must eventually either stop or switch out of autonomous mode."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications extracted from the document. They focus on the behavior of the vehicle when encountering no drivable lanes, ensuring that it stops before entering such lanes, remains stopped if already inside one, and issues a takeover request when necessary. The formulas use the temporal operators to express the required sequence of events and states that the vehicle must adhere to in various scenarios related to no drivable lanes.
