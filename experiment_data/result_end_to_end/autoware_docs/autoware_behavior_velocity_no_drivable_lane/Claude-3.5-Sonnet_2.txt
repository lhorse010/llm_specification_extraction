I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas as requested. Then, I'll format the results in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(no_drivable_lane → F(vehicle_stopped))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a no drivable lane is detected, the vehicle must eventually come to a stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(inside_no_drivable_lane → X(¬autonomous_driving))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is inside a no drivable lane, in the next state, autonomous driving must be disabled."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(approaching_no_drivable_lane ∧ (distance_to_no_drivable_lane > stop_margin) → F(vehicle_stopped))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is approaching a no drivable lane and the distance to it is greater than the stop margin, the vehicle must eventually come to a stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(vehicle_stopped ∧ no_drivable_lane → F(request_to_intervene))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is stopped due to a no drivable lane, it must eventually request driver intervention."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(¬(autonomous_driving ∧ inside_no_drivable_lane))",
            "explanation": "Globally, it should never be the case that the vehicle is in autonomous driving mode while inside a no drivable lane."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(state = INIT U (state = APPROACHING ∨ state = INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE))",
            "explanation": "Globally, the state remains INIT until it becomes either APPROACHING or INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((state = APPROACHING ∨ state = INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE) U state = STOPPED)",
            "explanation": "Globally, once the state is APPROACHING or INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE, it remains so until the state becomes STOPPED."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications extracted from the document, focusing on the behavior of the vehicle in relation to no drivable lanes, state transitions, and safety requirements.
