I've read through the document and extracted the relevant specifications. I'll now express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas and provide explanations for each.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(traffic_light_in_ego_lane → (F(stop_decision) ∨ F(go_decision)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when there is a traffic light in the ego lane, the system will eventually make either a stop or go decision."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((¬traffic_light_found ∨ traffic_light_timed_out) → F(treat_as_stop))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a corresponding traffic light signal is not found or has timed out, the system will eventually treat it as a signal to stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((highest_reliability_signal ∧ ¬(green_light ∨ corresponding_arrow)) → F(generate_stop_point))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the highest reliability signal is not green or a corresponding arrow, the system will eventually generate a stop point."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((stop_signal_received ∧ elapsed_time < stop_time_hysteresis) → F(treat_as_pass))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a stop signal is received but the elapsed time is less than the stop_time_hysteresis, the system will eventually treat it as a signal to pass."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((current_velocity > 2.0) → X(pass_judge_formula))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the current velocity is greater than 2.0 m/s, in the next state, the pass judge formula will be applied."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((current_velocity ≤ 2.0) → X(stop_decision))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the current velocity is less than or equal to 2.0 m/s, in the next state, a stop decision will be made."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((yellow_lamp ∧ can_pass_through) → F(pass_decision))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if it's a yellow lamp and the vehicle can pass through the stop line, the system will eventually make a pass decision."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((yellow_lamp ∧ ¬can_pass_through) → F(emergency_stop))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if it's a yellow lamp and the vehicle cannot pass through the stop line, the system will eventually initiate an emergency stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((in_dilemma_zone ∧ ¬can_pass_yellow ∧ ¬can_stop_normally) → F(emergency_stop))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in the dilemma zone, cannot pass during yellow, and cannot stop normally, the system will eventually initiate an emergency stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((in_optional_zone ∧ can_pass_yellow ∧ can_stop_normally) → F(stop_decision))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in the optional zone, can pass during yellow, and can stop normally, the system will eventually make a stop decision for safety."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the given document, focusing on the decision-making process for traffic light scenarios in autonomous vehicles. The formulas express the conditions under which the system should make stop or go decisions, handle various traffic light states, and manage special cases like the dilemma zone and optional zone.
