Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(traffic_light_signal -> (X(stop_point_generated) <-> (traffic_light_color != green âˆ§ traffic_light_color != arrow_signal)))",
            "explanation": "If a traffic light signal is detected, a stop point should be generated at the next time step if and only if the traffic light color is not green and not an arrow signal."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(elapsed_time_to_receive_stop_signal < stop_time_hysteresis -> X(pass_judge))",
            "explanation": "If the elapsed time to receive a stop signal is less than the stop time hysteresis, the vehicle should pass at the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(vehicle_current_velocity > 2.0m/s -> pass_judge)",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle's current velocity is higher than 2.0m/s, the vehicle should pass."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(vehicle_current_velocity <= 2.0m/s -> stop)",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle's current velocity is lower than or equal to 2.0m/s, the vehicle should stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(can_pass_through_stop_line_during_yellow_lamp -> pass)",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle can pass through the stop line during the yellow lamp, the vehicle should pass."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(!can_pass_through_stop_line_during_yellow_lamp -> emergency_stop)",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle cannot pass through the stop line during the yellow lamp, the vehicle should perform an emergency stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_dilemma_zone -> emergency_stop)",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle is in the dilemma zone, the vehicle should perform an emergency stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_optional_zone -> stop)",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle is in the optional zone, the vehicle should stop."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I've used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `traffic_light_signal`: a traffic light signal is detected
* `stop_point_generated`: a stop point is generated
* `traffic_light_color`: the color of the traffic light
* `arrow_signal`: an arrow signal is detected
* `elapsed_time_to_receive_stop_signal`: the elapsed time to receive a stop signal
* `stop_time_hysteresis`: the stop time hysteresis
* `pass_judge`: the vehicle should pass
* `vehicle_current_velocity`: the vehicle's current velocity
* `can_pass_through_stop_line_during_yellow_lamp`: the vehicle can pass through the stop line during the yellow lamp
* `emergency_stop`: the vehicle should perform an emergency stop
* `in_dilemma_zone`: the vehicle is in the dilemma zone
* `in_optional_zone`: the vehicle is in the optional zone

These abbreviations are used to make the MTL formulas more readable and concise.
