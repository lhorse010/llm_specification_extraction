I've read the document thoroughly and extracted the relevant specifications. Now, I'll express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas and provide explanations for each.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(traffic_light_in_ego_lane → X(process_traffic_light))",
            "explanation": "Globally, whenever there is a traffic light in the ego lane, in the next state, the system must process the traffic light information."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((¬traffic_light_found ∨ traffic_light_timed_out) → signal_to_stop)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a corresponding traffic light signal is not found or has timed out, the system must signal to stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((traffic_light_found ∧ ¬traffic_light_timed_out ∧ highest_reliability_color ≠ green) → generate_stop_point)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a traffic light is found, not timed out, and its highest reliability color is not green, generate a stop point."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((stop_signal_received ∧ elapsed_time < stop_time_hysteresis) → signal_to_pass)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a stop signal is received but the elapsed time is less than the stop time hysteresis, treat it as a signal to pass to prevent chattering."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((current_velocity > 2.0) → apply_pass_judge_formula)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the current velocity is greater than 2.0 m/s, apply the pass judge formula."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((current_velocity ≤ 2.0) → stop)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the current velocity is less than or equal to 2.0 m/s, stop the vehicle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((in_yellow_lamp ∧ can_pass_through_stop_line) → pass)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in the yellow lamp phase and can pass through the stop line, it should pass."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((in_yellow_lamp ∧ ¬can_pass_through_stop_line) → emergency_stop)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in the yellow lamp phase and cannot pass through the stop line, perform an emergency stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((in_dilemma_zone ∧ ¬can_pass_through_yellow_lamp ∧ ¬can_stop_normally) → emergency_stop)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in the dilemma zone, cannot pass through during the yellow lamp, and cannot stop normally, perform an emergency stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((in_optional_zone ∧ can_pass_through_yellow_lamp ∧ can_stop_normally) → stop)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in the optional zone, can pass through during the yellow lamp, and can stop normally, choose to stop for safety."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the provided document, focusing on the behavior of the vehicle in response to traffic light signals and various conditions. The formulas cover activation timing, decision-making processes, and handling of different scenarios such as the dilemma zone and optional zone.
