Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required output format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G((lane_id = intersection) → X activation)",
            "explanation": "The blind spot module is activated when the lane ID of the target path has an intersection label."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((object ∈ detection_area ∧ object_path ∈ conflict_area) → X stop)",
            "explanation": "The module transitions to the 'stop' state when an object is in the detection area and its predicted path is in the conflict area."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(pass_judge_line → ¬stop)",
            "explanation": "The 'stop' judgment is not executed after the judgment line is passed to avoid rapid stops."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(stop → G¬go U (go ∧ G(go ∧ ¬stop) ≥ 2))",
            "explanation": "Once a 'stop' is judged, the module will not transition to the 'go' state until the 'go' judgment continues for at least 2 seconds to prevent chattering."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((stop ∧ go) → X go)",
            "explanation": "When the module is in the 'stop' state and the 'go' condition is met, it will transition to the 'go' state."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I've used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `lane_id = intersection` represents the condition that the lane ID of the target path has an intersection label.
* `object ∈ detection_area` represents the condition that an object is in the detection area.
* `object_path ∈ conflict_area` represents the condition that an object's predicted path is in the conflict area.
* `pass_judge_line` represents the condition that the judgment line has been passed.
* `stop` and `go` represent the states of the module.
* `X` represents the next state.
* `G` represents the globally operator.
* `U` represents the until operator.
* `∧` represents the and operator.
* `¬` represents the negation operator.
* `→` represents the implies operator.
