After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required output format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(detection_area → F(stop_planning))",
            "explanation": "If a pointcloud is detected in a detection area, stop planning will be executed at the predetermined point."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(activation_timing → F(module_activation))",
            "explanation": "The module is activated when there is a detection area on the target lane."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((detection_area ∧ pointcloud_in_area) → F(stop_point_insertion))",
            "explanation": "If there is a detection area and pointcloud in the area, a stop point is inserted in front of the stop line."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((stop_point_insertion ∧ ego_vehicle_in_front_of_pass_judge_point) → F(velocity_set_to_zero))",
            "explanation": "If the ego-vehicle is in front of the pass judge point, the velocity is set to zero behind the stop line."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((ego_vehicle_passed_pass_judge_point) → F(no_stopping))",
            "explanation": "If the ego-vehicle has passed the pass judge point, it doesn’t stop and passes through."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((vehicle_stopped ∧ _front_to_stop_line < hold_stop_margin_distance) → F(no_restart))",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle is stopped within hold_stop_margin_distance meters from the stop point, the module judges that the vehicle has already stopped and plans to keep stopping at the current position."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `detection_area`: a detection area is defined on the map
* `pointcloud_in_area`: a pointcloud is detected in the detection area
* `activation_timing`: the module is activated when there is a detection area on the target lane
* `module_activation`: the module is activated
* `stop_point_insertion`: a stop point is inserted in front of the stop line
* `ego_vehicle_in_front_of_pass_judge_point`: the ego-vehicle is in front of the pass judge point
* `velocity_set_to_zero`: the velocity is set to zero behind the stop line
* `ego_vehicle_passed_pass_judge_point`: the ego-vehicle has passed the pass judge point
* `no_stopping`: the vehicle doesn’t stop and passes through
* `vehicle_stopped`: the vehicle is stopped
* `_front_to_stop_line`: the distance from the vehicle to the stop line
* `hold_stop_margin_distance`: the parameter to prevent redundant restart
* `no_restart`: the module judges that the vehicle has already stopped and plans to keep stopping at the current position.
