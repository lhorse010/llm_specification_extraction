Let's go through the steps to extract and formalize the specifications using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL).

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have carefully read the provided document about the Detection Area module.

Step 4: Extract specifications and express them using metric temporal logic formula.

Step 5: Format all the converted sentences in JSON.

Here's the output in the required format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(pointcloud_detected_in_area → F[0,l] stop)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a pointcloud is detected in the defined area, then the vehicle must stop within l meters (where l is the distance from the current position to the predetermined stop point)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_target_lane ∧ detection_area_present → X module_activated)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in the target lane and a detection area is present, then in the next state, the module must be activated."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(distance_to_stop_line < pass_judge_point ∧ pointcloud_detected → X(velocity = 0))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the distance to the stop line is less than the pass judge point and a pointcloud is detected, then in the next state, the velocity must be zero."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(distance_to_pass_judge_point < 0 → ¬stop)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the distance to the pass judge point is negative (i.e., the vehicle has passed it), then the vehicle must not stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(stopped ∧ (front_to_stop_line < hold_stop_margin_distance) → X keep_stopping)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is stopped and the distance from the front of the vehicle to the stop line is less than the hold_stop_margin_distance, then in the next state, the vehicle must keep stopping."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the provided document, focusing on the clear and specific requirements for the Detection Area module's behavior.
