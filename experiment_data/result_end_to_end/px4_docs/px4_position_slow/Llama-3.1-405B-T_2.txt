After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G((Position_Slow_Mode → (velocity ≤ MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL)) ∧ (velocity ≥ -MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow Mode, the vehicle's horizontal velocity is always within the limits set by MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Position_Slow_Mode → (vertical_velocity ≤ MC_SLOW_MAX_VVEL)) ∧ (vertical_velocity ≥ -MC_SLOW_MAX_VVEL))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow Mode, the vehicle's vertical velocity is always within the limits set by MC_SLOW_MAX_VVEL."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Position_Slow_Mode → (yaw_rate ≤ MC_SLOW_MAX_YRATE)) ∧ (yaw_rate ≥ -MC_SLOW_MAX_YRATE))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow Mode, the vehicle's yaw rate is always within the limits set by MC_SLOW_MAX_YRATE."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((RC_Control_Input → (velocity ≤ max_velocity)) ∧ (velocity ≥ min_velocity))",
            "explanation": "When using RC Control Input, the vehicle's velocity is always within the limits set by the input control."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((MAVLink_Message → (velocity ≤ max_velocity)) ∧ (velocity ≥ min_velocity))",
            "explanation": "When using MAVLink Message, the vehicle's velocity is always within the limits set by the message."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Position_Slow_Mode → (velocity ≤ MC_SLOW_MIN_HVEL) U (velocity ≤ MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow Mode, the vehicle's velocity is reduced to MC_SLOW_MIN_HVEL if it exceeds MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Position_Slow_Mode ∧ (velocity > MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL)) → F(velocity ≤ MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow Mode, if the vehicle's velocity exceeds MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL, it will eventually be reduced to MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `Position_Slow_Mode`: The vehicle is in Position Slow Mode.
* `velocity`: The vehicle's horizontal velocity.
* `vertical_velocity`: The vehicle's vertical velocity.
* `yaw_rate`: The vehicle's yaw rate.
* `MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL`: The maximum horizontal velocity limit in Position Slow Mode.
* `MC_SLOW_MAX_VVEL`: The maximum vertical velocity limit in Position Slow Mode.
* `MC_SLOW_MAX_YRATE`: The maximum yaw rate limit in Position Slow Mode.
* `RC_Control_Input`: The vehicle is using RC Control Input.
* `MAVLink_Message`: The vehicle is using MAVLink Message.
* `max_velocity`: The maximum velocity limit set by the input control or MAVLink message.
* `min_velocity`: The minimum velocity limit set by the input control or MAVLink message.
* `MC_SLOW_MIN_HVEL`: The minimum horizontal velocity limit in Position Slow Mode.
