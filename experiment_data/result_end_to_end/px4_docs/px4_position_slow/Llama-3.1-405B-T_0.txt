After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(max_horizontal_velocity <= 10)",
            "explanation": "The maximum horizontal velocity in Position mode should not exceed 10 m/s."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(max_vertical_velocity <= MPC_VEL_MANUAL)",
            "explanation": "The maximum vertical velocity in Position mode should not exceed the value set by the MPC_VEL_MANUAL parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(max_yaw_rate <= MC_SLOW_MAX_YRATE)",
            "explanation": "The maximum yaw rate in Position mode should not exceed the value set by the MC_SLOW_MAX_YRATE parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(slow_mode -> (max_horizontal_velocity <= MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow mode, the maximum horizontal velocity should not exceed the value set by the MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(slow_mode -> (max_vertical_velocity <= MC_SLOW_MAX_VVEL))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow mode, the maximum vertical velocity should not exceed the value set by the MC_SLOW_MAX_VVEL parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(slow_mode -> (max_yaw_rate <= MC_SLOW_MAX_YRATE))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow mode, the maximum yaw rate should not exceed the value set by the MC_SLOW_MAX_YRATE parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RC_control_input -> (max_velocity_axis <= MC_SLOW_MIN_ + (RC_control_input * (MPC_VEL_MANUAL - MC_SLOW_MIN_))))",
            "explanation": "When using RC control input to set the maximum velocity, the maximum velocity of the axis should be scaled between the minimum value set by the MC_SLOW_MIN_ parameter and the maximum value set by the MPC_VEL_MANUAL parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(MAVLink_message -> (max_velocity_axis <= SET_VELOCITY_LIMITS))",
            "explanation": "When using MAVLink message to set the maximum velocity, the maximum velocity of the axis should not exceed the value set by the SET_VELOCITY_LIMITS message."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(slow_mode -> F(max_velocity_axis <= MC_SLOW_MAX_))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow mode, the vehicle should eventually slow down to a velocity not exceeding the maximum value set by the MC_SLOW_MAX_ parameter."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `max_horizontal_velocity`, `max_vertical_velocity`, and `max_yaw_rate` represent the maximum velocities and yaw rate of the vehicle.
* `MPC_VEL_MANUAL`, `MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL`, `MC_SLOW_MAX_VVEL`, and `MC_SLOW_MAX_YRATE` represent the parameters that set the maximum velocities and yaw rate in Position mode and Position Slow mode.
* `MC_SLOW_MIN_` represents the minimum value of the maximum velocity axis in Position Slow mode.
* `RC_control_input` represents the input from the RC controller.
* `MAVLink_message` represents the MAVLink message that sets the maximum velocity.
* `SET_VELOCITY_LIMITS` represents the value set by the MAVLink message.
* `slow_mode` represents the Position Slow mode.
* `G` represents the globally operator, which means that the formula should hold true at all times.
* `F` represents the finally operator, which means that the formula should hold true eventually.
