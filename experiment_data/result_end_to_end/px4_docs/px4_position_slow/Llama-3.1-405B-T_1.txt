After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G((Position_Slow_Mode → (Horizontal_Velocity ≤ MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL)) ∧ (Position_Slow_Mode → (Vertical_Velocity ≤ MC_SLOW_MAX_VVEL)) ∧ (Position_Slow_Mode → (Yaw_Rate ≤ MC_SLOW_MAX_YRATE)))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow Mode, the vehicle's horizontal velocity, vertical velocity, and yaw rate must not exceed the maximum values set by the MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL, MC_SLOW_MAX_VVEL, and MC_SLOW_MAX_YRATE parameters, respectively."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Position_Slow_Mode ∧ (RC_Control_Input = Highest_Value)) → (Horizontal_Velocity = MPC_VEL_MANUAL))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow Mode, if the RC control input is set to its highest value, the vehicle's horizontal velocity must be equal to the value set by the MPC_VEL_MANUAL parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Position_Slow_Mode ∧ (RC_Control_Input = Lowest_Value)) → (Horizontal_Velocity = MC_SLOW_MIN_HVEL))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow Mode, if the RC control input is set to its lowest value, the vehicle's horizontal velocity must be equal to the value set by the MC_SLOW_MIN_HVEL parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((MAVLink_Message_Received ∧ (SET_VELOCITY_LIMITS ≠ NAN)) → (Velocity_Limit_Updated))",
            "explanation": "When a MAVLink message is received with a non-NAN SET_VELOCITY_LIMITS value, the vehicle's velocity limit must be updated."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Position_Slow_Mode ∧ (Velocity > MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL)) → F(Velocity ≤ MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL))",
            "explanation": "In Position Slow Mode, if the vehicle's velocity exceeds the maximum value set by the MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL parameter, the vehicle must slow down to a velocity less than or equal to the maximum value."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `Position_Slow_Mode`: The vehicle is in Position Slow Mode.
* `Horizontal_Velocity`, `Vertical_Velocity`, and `Yaw_Rate`: The vehicle's horizontal velocity, vertical velocity, and yaw rate, respectively.
* `MC_SLOW_MAX_HVEL`, `MC_SLOW_MAX_VVEL`, and `MC_SLOW_MAX_YRATE`: The maximum values for the vehicle's horizontal velocity, vertical velocity, and yaw rate in Position Slow Mode, respectively.
* `MPC_VEL_MANUAL`: The value set by the MPC_VEL_MANUAL parameter.
* `RC_Control_Input`: The input from the RC controller.
* `MAVLink_Message_Received`: A MAVLink message has been received.
* `SET_VELOCITY_LIMITS`: The SET_VELOCITY_LIMITS value in the MAVLink message.
* `Velocity_Limit_Updated`: The vehicle's velocity limit has been updated.
* `Velocity`: The vehicle's velocity.
* `NAN`: Not a number (i.e., an invalid value).
