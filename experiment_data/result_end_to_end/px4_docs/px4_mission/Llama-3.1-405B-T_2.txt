Based on the provided document, I have extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(armed → F(mission_started))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle must be armed before the mission can be started."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_started → F(in_mission_mode))",
            "explanation": "Once the mission is started, the vehicle will enter mission mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_mission_mode → (mission_loaded ∧ ¬manual_intervention))",
            "explanation": "In mission mode, the vehicle will execute the loaded mission without manual intervention."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(no_mission_loaded → (flying → G(hold)))",
            "explanation": "If no mission is loaded and the vehicle is flying, it will hold its current position."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(no_mission_loaded → (landed → G(wait)))",
            "explanation": "If no mission is loaded and the vehicle is landed, it will wait."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_loaded ∧ flying → F(execute_mission))",
            "explanation": "If a mission is loaded and the vehicle is flying, it will execute the mission."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_loaded ∧ landed → F(execute_mission))",
            "explanation": "If a mission is loaded and the vehicle is landed, it will execute the mission."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_paused → (¬in_mission_mode → G(resume_mission)))",
            "explanation": "If the mission is paused and the vehicle is not in mission mode, it will resume the mission when switched back to mission mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_paused ∧ camera_triggering → (resume_mission → G(retrace_path)))",
            "explanation": "If the mission is paused while the camera is triggering, the vehicle will retrace its path when the mission is resumed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_feasibility_checks → (feasible → F(start_mission)))",
            "explanation": "If the mission feasibility checks pass, the vehicle will start the mission."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_feasibility_checks → (¬feasible → G(abort_mission)))",
            "explanation": "If the mission feasibility checks fail, the vehicle will abort the mission."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `armed`: The vehicle is armed.
* `mission_started`: The mission has been started.
* `in_mission_mode`: The vehicle is in mission mode.
* `mission_loaded`: A mission is loaded.
* `manual_intervention`: Manual intervention is required.
* `flying`: The vehicle is flying.
* `landed`: The vehicle is landed.
* `hold`: The vehicle is holding its current position.
* `wait`: The vehicle is waiting.
* `execute_mission`: The vehicle is executing the mission.
* `mission_paused`: The mission is paused.
* `resume_mission`: The mission is resumed.
* `camera_triggering`: The camera is triggering.
* `retrace_path`: The vehicle retraces its path.
* `mission_feasibility_checks`: The mission feasibility checks are performed.
* `feasible`: The mission is feasible.
* `start_mission`: The mission is started.
* `abort_mission`: The mission is aborted.
