    "explanation": "When the sticks are released/centered, the vehicle will actively brake, level, and be locked to a position in 3D space."

    "formula": "G((roll_stick ≠ 0 ∨ pitch_stick ≠ 0) → X(vehicle_accelerating ∧ vehicle_ramping_down_until_final_velocity))",
    "explanation": "With full stick deflection, the vehicle accelerates initially with MPC_ACC_HOR_MAX ramping down until it reaches the final velocity MPC_VEL_MANUAL."

    "formula": "G((throttle_stick > 0.625) → X(vehicle_taking_off))",

    "explanation": "Landing in this mode is easy: position the drone horizontally above the landing spot, let go of the roll and pitch stick, and pull the throttle stick down gently until the vehicle touches the ground and disarms."

    "explanation": "If the vehicle does not detect the ground/landing and disarm, switch to Stabilized mode keeping the throttle stick low, and manually disarm using a gesture or other command."
