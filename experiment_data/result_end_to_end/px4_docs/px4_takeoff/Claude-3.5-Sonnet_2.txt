Let's go through the steps to extract specifications and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the document about the Takeoff Mode for Multicopter.

Step 4: Extract specifications and express them using metric temporal logic formula.
Step 5: Format all the converted sentences in JSON.

Here's the output in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(takeoff_mode → ¬user_intervention_required)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in takeoff mode, user intervention is not required to control the vehicle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(takeoff_mode → valid_local_position)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in takeoff mode, a valid local position estimate is required."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((flying ∧ ¬valid_local_position) → ¬takeoff_mode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is flying and does not have a valid local position, it cannot switch to takeoff mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((flying ∧ takeoff_mode ∧ X(¬valid_local_position)) → X(failsafe))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is flying in takeoff mode and in the next state loses valid position estimate, it will enter failsafe in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((¬armed ∧ ¬valid_local_position) → (takeoff_mode → ¬F(armed)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is disarmed and doesn't have a valid local position, it can enter takeoff mode but cannot become armed in the future."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(takeoff_mode → F(altitude = MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in takeoff mode, the vehicle will eventually reach the altitude defined in MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((takeoff_mode ∧ rc_stick_movement ∧ ¬critical_battery) → X(position_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in takeoff mode, if there's RC stick movement and no critical battery failsafe, the vehicle will switch to Position mode in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((takeoff_mode ∧ failure_detected) → X(engines_stopped))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in takeoff mode, if a failure is detected, the engines will be stopped in the next state."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the provided document about the Takeoff Mode for Multicopter. They cover the requirements for entering the mode, behavior during takeoff, responses to various conditions, and safety measures.
