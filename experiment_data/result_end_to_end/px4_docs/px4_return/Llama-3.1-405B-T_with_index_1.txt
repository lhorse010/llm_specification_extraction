    "explanation": "The return mode is automatic, and no user intervention is required to control the vehicle."
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G(global_position_estimate → X(automatic_mode))",
    "explanation": "The return mode requires a global 3D position estimate (from GPS or inferred from a local position)."
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(home_position_set → X(automatic_mode))",
    "explanation": "The return mode requires the home position to be set."
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G(automatic_mode → ¬arming)",
    "explanation": "The return mode prevents arming (the vehicle must be armed when switching to this mode)."

    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(RC_control_switch → X(mode_change))",
    "explanation": "RC control switches can be used to change flight modes on any vehicle."

  {
    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G(RC_stick_movement → X(position_mode))",
    "explanation": "RC stick movement will by default change the vehicle to Position mode unless handling a critical battery failsafe."

  {
    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G(return_mode → F(ascend_to_min_return_altitude))",
    "explanation": "The vehicle ascends to the minimum return altitude (safely above any expected obstacles)."
  },
  {
    "index": 7,
    "formula": "G(ascend_to_min_return_altitude → F(fly_to_safe_landing_point))",
    "explanation": "The vehicle flies via a direct constant-altitude path to the safe landing point."

  {
    "index": 8,
    "formula": "G(arrival_at_destination → F(descend_to_descent_altitude))",
    "explanation": "On arrival at its destination, the vehicle rapidly descends to the 'descent altitude' (RTL_DESCEND_ALT)."
  },
  {
    "index": 9,
    "formula": "G(descend_to_descent_altitude → F(wait_for_configurable_time))",
    "explanation": "The vehicle waits for a configurable time (RTL_LAND_DELAY) before landing."

    "explanation": "The vehicle lands after waiting for the configurable time."
