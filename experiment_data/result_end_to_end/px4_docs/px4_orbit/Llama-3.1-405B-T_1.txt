After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G (valid_local_position_estimate → mode_enabled)",
            "explanation": "The mode requires at least a valid local position estimate to be enabled."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (¬valid_local_position_estimate → failsafe)",
            "explanation": "Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (mode_enabled → armed)",
            "explanation": "The mode prevents arming; the vehicle must be armed when switching to this mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (wind_and_flight_time_within_limits → mode_enabled)",
            "explanation": "The mode requires wind and flight time to be within allowed limits."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (multicopter_or_vtol_in_mc_mode → mode_supported)",
            "explanation": "The mode is currently only supported on multicopter (or VTOL in MC mode)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (rc_stick_movement → control_ascent_descent_or_orbit_speed_and_direction)",
            "explanation": "RC stick movement can control ascent/descent and orbit speed and direction."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (MAV_CMD_DO_ORBIT → mode_triggered)",
            "explanation": "The mode can be triggered using the MAV_CMD_DO_ORBIT MAVLink command."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (mode_enabled → fly_to_closest_point_on_circle_trajectory)",
            "explanation": "Once enabled, the vehicle will fly as fast as possible to the closest point on the commanded circle trajectory."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (orbit_started → slow_clockwise_orbit)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will do a slow (1m/s) clockwise orbit on the planned circle, facing the center."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (left_stick_up_down → control_ascent_descent_speed)",
            "explanation": "The left stick controls the speed of ascent/descent."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (right_stick_left_right → control_orbit_acceleration)",
            "explanation": "The right stick controls the acceleration of orbit in clockwise/counter-clockwise directions."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (right_stick_up_down → control_orbit_radius)",
            "explanation": "The right stick controls the orbit radius (smaller/bigger)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (orbit_speed > 10m/s → limit_orbit_speed)",
            "explanation": "The maximum velocity is 10m/s and further limited to keep the centripetal acceleration below 2m/s^2."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (orbit_radius < 1m → limit_orbit_radius)",
            "explanation": "The minimum radius is 1m."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (orbit_radius > 100m → limit_orbit_radius)",
            "explanation": "The maximum radius is 100m."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have excluded vague specifications and focused on clear and specific requirements. I have also used the MTL operators to express the temporal relationships between the different variables and events.
