After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required output format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(land_mode → F(landed ∧ disarm))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in land mode, it will eventually land and disarm."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(land_mode → ¬arming)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in land mode, it cannot arm."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(local_position_estimate → (X land_mode ∨ X failsafe))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle has a valid local position estimate, it will either switch to land mode or failsafe in the next step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(land_mode → G(descend_speed = MPC_LAND_SPEED))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in land mode, it will descend at the rate specified in MPC_LAND_SPEED."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RC_stick_movement → X position_mode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if there is RC stick movement, the vehicle will switch to position mode in the next step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(critical_battery_failsafe → ¬(RC_stick_movement → X position_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if there is a critical battery failsafe, RC stick movement will not switch the vehicle to position mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(MAV_CMD_NAV_LAND → X land_mode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the MAV_CMD_NAV_LAND command is received, the vehicle will switch to land mode in the next step."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have excluded vague specifications and only included clear and specific requirements. I have also used the MTL operators to express the temporal relationships between the different events and states.
