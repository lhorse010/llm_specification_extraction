After carefully reading the document, I extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet in Land Mode (Multicopter). Here are the specifications expressed using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(land_mode → F(landed ∧ disarm))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in land mode, it will eventually land and disarm."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(land_mode → ¬arming)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in land mode, it cannot arm."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(local_position_estimate → (X land_mode ∨ X failsafe))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle has a valid local position estimate, it will either switch to land mode or failsafe in the next step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(land_mode → G(descend_speed = MPC_LAND_SPEED))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in land mode, it will descend at the rate specified in MPC_LAND_SPEED."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(land_mode ∧ RC_stick_movement → X position_mode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in land mode and there is RC stick movement, it will switch to position mode in the next step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(¬local_position_estimate → failsafe)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle loses its local position estimate, it will failsafe."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I excluded vague specifications and only included clear and specific ones. I also used the MTL operators to express the temporal relationships between the different states and events.
