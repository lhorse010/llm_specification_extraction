After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet in Land Mode (Multicopter). Here are the specifications expressed using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G (LandMode → F (Landed ∧ Disarmed))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in Land Mode, it will eventually land and disarm."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (LandMode → ¬Arming)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in Land Mode, it cannot arm."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (LandMode → ValidLocalPositionEstimate)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in Land Mode, it requires a valid local position estimate."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (Flying ∧ ¬ValidLocalPositionEstimate → Failsafe)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is flying and loses its local position estimate, it will failsafe."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (LandMode ∧ RCStickMovement → X PositionMode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in Land Mode and there is RC stick movement, it will switch to Position Mode in the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (LandMode → DescendAtRate(MPC_LAND_SPEED))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is in Land Mode, it will descend at the rate specified in MPC_LAND_SPEED."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have excluded vague specifications and only included clear and specific requirements. I have also used the MTL operators to express the temporal relationships between the different states and events.
