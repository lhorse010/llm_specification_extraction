    "explanation": "Globally, if the control sticks are centered, then in the next state, the angular rotation rate around all axes should be zero."

    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G(¬stick_centered → (angular_rotation_rate ≠ 0))",
    "explanation": "Globally, if the control sticks are not centered, then the angular rotation rate around the respective axis should be non-zero."

  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(throttle_input = control_allocation_output)",
    "explanation": "Globally, the throttle input should be directly passed to the control allocation output."

    "formula": "G((roll_stick ∨ pitch_stick ∨ yaw_stick) → F(orientation_change))",
    "explanation": "Globally, if there's input on the roll, pitch, or yaw stick, then eventually there should be a change in the vehicle's orientation."

  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(manual_control_input → acro_mode_active)",
    "explanation": "Globally, if there's manual control input (RC control or joystick), then Acro mode should be active."

  {
    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G(acro_mode_active → (autopilot_stabilize_attitude_rate ∧ manual_throttle_control))",
    "explanation": "Globally, when Acro mode is active, the autopilot should assist in stabilizing the attitude rate, and throttle should be under manual control."

    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G(max_stick_input → high_turn_rate)",
    "explanation": "Globally, maximum stick input should result in a high turn rate for performing acrobatic maneuvers."

    "index": 7,
    "formula": "G(near_center_stick_input → low_sensitivity)",
    "explanation": "Globally, stick input near the center should result in a zone of lower sensitivity for small corrections."
