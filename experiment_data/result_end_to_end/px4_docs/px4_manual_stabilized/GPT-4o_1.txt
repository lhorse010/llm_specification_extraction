            "explanation": "When the control sticks are centered, the multicopter should maintain a level attitude by setting the roll and pitch angles to zero."

            "explanation": "When the control sticks are outside the center, they should control the roll and pitch angles, yaw rate, and throttle for movement and altitude."

            "formula": "G(centered_sticks → F(hover_in_place))",
            "explanation": "When the control sticks return to the center, the multicopter should eventually hover in place, maintaining altitude if no external forces are applied."

            "explanation": "The autopilot does not compensate for drift due to wind, so this behavior must be acknowledged."
