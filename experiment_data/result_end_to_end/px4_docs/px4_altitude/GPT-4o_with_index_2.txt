    "formula": "G((throttle > 0.5) → F(takeoff))",
    "explanation": "If the throttle is raised above 50%, the vehicle should eventually take off."

    "formula": "G(throttle = 0.5 → altitude_steady)",
    "explanation": "If the throttle is at 50%, the altitude should remain steady against the wind."

    "formula": "G(yaw_stick → control_rotation_rate)",
    "explanation": "The yaw stick controls the rate of angular rotation over the horizontal plane."
