    "index": 0,
    "formula": "G((centered_sticks) → (vehicle_level ∧ altitude_steady))",
    "explanation": "When the sticks are centered, the vehicle will level and maintain the current altitude."
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G((outside_center ∧ roll_pitch_sticks) → (tilt_angle_control ∧ movement))",
    "explanation": "When the sticks are outside the center, the roll/pitch sticks control the tilt angle, resulting in corresponding left-right and forward-back movement."
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G((outside_center ∧ throttle_stick) → (up_down_speed_control ∧ movement_speed_control))",
    "explanation": "When the sticks are outside the center, the throttle stick controls the up/down speed with a predetermined maximum rate and movement speed in other axes."
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G((outside_center ∧ yaw_stick) → (angular_rotation_rate_control))",
    "explanation": "When the sticks are outside the center, the yaw stick controls the rate of angular rotation above the horizontal plane."
  },
  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G((throttle_stick > 62.5%) → F(takeoff))",
    "explanation": "When the throttle stick is raised above 62.5%, the vehicle will take off."
  },
  {
    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G((wind) → F(vehicle_drift))",
    "explanation": "If the wind blows, the aircraft will drift in the direction of the wind."
  },
  {
    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G((centered_sticks ∧ wind) → (vehicle_altitude_steady))",
    "explanation": "When the sticks are centered and there is wind, the vehicle will maintain its altitude steady against the wind."
  },
  {
    "index": 7,
    "formula": "G((manual_control_input) → (autopilot_assistance))",
    "explanation": "Manual control input is required, and the autopilot provides assistance to stabilize the attitude, hold position against wind, and stabilize the attitude rate."
