I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas as requested. Then, I'll format the results in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(stick_centered → (level ∧ X(altitude = altitude)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the sticks are centered, the vehicle will level and maintain the current altitude in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((roll_stick ≠ 0 ∨ pitch_stick ≠ 0) → X(horizontal_movement))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when roll or pitch sticks are not centered, the vehicle will move horizontally in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(yaw_stick ≠ 0 → X(rotation_rate ≠ 0))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the yaw stick is not centered, the vehicle's rotation rate will be non-zero in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_stick > 0.5 → X(altitude > altitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the throttle stick is above the center position, the altitude will increase in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_stick < 0.5 → X(altitude < altitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the throttle stick is below the center position, the altitude will decrease in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(landed ∧ throttle_stick > 0.625 → X(takeoff))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the vehicle is landed and the throttle stick is raised above 62.5%, the vehicle will take off in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(¬manual_control → ¬(roll ∨ pitch ∨ yaw ∨ throttle))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if there is no manual control input, there should be no roll, pitch, yaw, or throttle movement."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((roll_stick ≠ 0 ∨ pitch_stick ≠ 0) → X(tilt_angle ≠ 0))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when roll or pitch sticks are not centered, the vehicle's tilt angle will be non-zero in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(F(wind ≠ 0) → F(drift))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if there is wind at any point in the future, the vehicle will eventually drift."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(lidar_sensor → F(accurate_altitude_control))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a LIDAR sensor is present, eventually there will be accurate altitude control."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications of the Altitude Mode for multicopters as described in the document. They cover aspects such as stick behavior, altitude maintenance, horizontal movement, rotation, takeoff conditions, and the influence of sensors on altitude control accuracy.
