    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G (throttle_above_62_5_percent → F takeoff)",
    "explanation": "If the throttle is raised above 62.5%, the vehicle will eventually take off."

    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G (throttle_at_50_percent → X altitude_stable)",
    "explanation": "When the throttle is at approximately 50%, the vehicle should maintain its current altitude in the next state."

  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G (roll_pitch_input → X (adjust_orientation ∧ move_in_direction))",
    "explanation": "If roll or pitch input is given, the vehicle should adjust its orientation and move in the corresponding direction in the next state."
  },
  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G (yaw_input → X adjust_rotation_rate)",
    "explanation": "If yaw input is given, the vehicle should adjust its rate of rotation in the corresponding direction in the next state."

    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G (altitude_mode_on → (F (altitude_stable ∧ ¬gps_needed)))",
    "explanation": "In altitude mode, the vehicle should eventually stabilize altitude without requiring GPS."

    "formula": "G (barometer_inaccurate → F lidar_accurate)",
    "explanation": "If the barometer becomes inaccurate, the vehicle should eventually use LIDAR for more reliable altitude control."
