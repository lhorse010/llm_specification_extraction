I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas as requested. Then, I'll format the output in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_centered → X(altitude_constant))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the throttle is centered, then in the next state, the altitude remains constant. This captures the requirement that when sticks are released/centered, the vehicle maintains the current altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(stick_released → X(vehicle_level))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the sticks are released, then in the next state, the vehicle levels. This represents the specification that when sticks are released/centered, the vehicle will level."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle > 62.5% ∧ vehicle_landed → X(vehicle_takeoff))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the throttle is above 62.5% and the vehicle is landed, then in the next state, the vehicle takes off. This captures the takeoff condition specified in the document."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(¬stick_centered → (roll_pitch_control ∧ yaw_rate_control ∧ throttle_speed_control))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the sticks are not centered, then roll/pitch controls tilt angle, yaw controls rotation rate, and throttle controls up/down speed. This formula encapsulates the control behavior when sticks are outside the center position."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(manual_control_input)",
            "explanation": "Globally, manual control input is required. This represents the specification that manual control input (such as RC control or joystick) is always necessary."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(roll_pitch_input → X(autopilot_stabilize_attitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if there's roll or pitch input, then in the next state, the autopilot assists in stabilizing the attitude. This captures the assistance provided by the autopilot for roll and pitch control."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(yaw_input → X(autopilot_stabilize_attitude_rate))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if there's yaw input, then in the next state, the autopilot assists in stabilizing the attitude rate. This represents the autopilot's assistance in yaw control."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(F(wind_present) → F(vehicle_drift))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if at some point wind is present, then at some point the vehicle will drift. This captures the behavior of the vehicle drifting in the direction of the wind."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the provided document about the Altitude Mode for Multicopters. They cover aspects such as altitude maintenance, vehicle leveling, takeoff conditions, control behaviors, manual input requirements, autopilot assistance, and wind effects. The formulas use the temporal operators G (globally), X (next), and F (finally) to express the temporal relationships between different states and actions of the multicopter system.
