Explanation:
- Sentence 1 in section 0 conveys a requirement for the system to maintain the current altitude when the sticks are released/centered.
- Sentence 2 in section 0 conveys that the system will continue moving in the horizontal plane until any momentum is dissipated by wind resistance.
- Sentence 1 in section 1 conveys that the system in the Altitude Mode is like the Stabilized mode but additionally locks the vehicle altitude when the sticks are released.
- Sentence 0 in section 2 conveys that the system is like a manual mode but with altitude stabilization.
- Sentence 3 in section 2 conveys that the system levels the vehicle when the sticks are centered.
- Sentence 4 in section 2 conveys that the throttle holds the current altitude steady against wind when the sticks are centered.
- Sentence 6 in section 2 conveys that the system controls the tilt angle in respective orientations when the sticks are outside the center, resulting in corresponding left-right and forward-back movement.
- Sentence 7 in section 2 conveys that the system controls up/down speed with a predetermined maximum rate and movement speed in other axes when the throttle stick is outside the center.
- Sentence 8 in section 2 conveys that the system controls the rate of angular rotation above the horizontal plane.
- Sentence 10 in section 2 conveys that the system will take off if the throttle stick is raised above 62.5% percent when the vehicle is landed.
- Sentence 11 in section 2 conveys that the system normally measures altitude using a barometer, which may become inaccurate in extreme weather conditions.
- Sentence 13 in section 2 conveys that the system requires manual control input.
- Sentence 15 in section 2 conveys that the system provides assistance from autopilot to stabilize the attitude, with the position of the RC stick mapping to the orientation of the vehicle.
- Sentence 16 in section 2 conveys that the system provides assistance from autopilot to hold the position against wind.
- Sentence 18 in section 2 conveys that the system provides assistance from autopilot to stabilize the attitude rate, with the position of the RC stick mapping to the rate of rotation of the vehicle in that orientation.
