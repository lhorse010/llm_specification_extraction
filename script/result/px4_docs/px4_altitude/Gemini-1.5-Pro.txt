**Reasoning:**

1. **Step 1 & 2: Read and Categorize:** The document describes the Altitude Mode for multicopter control.  Each sentence was evaluated against the four categories: "state transition pre-requirement", "constraint", "expected post-action", and "expected state change".

2. **Step 3: Annotate Specifications:** Sentences meeting the criteria were marked as specifications.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Section 0, Sentence 1:** "When the sticks are released/centered the vehicle will level and maintain the current altitude." This describes an *expected state change* (leveling and altitude maintenance) upon a specific input (releasing/centering the sticks).

* **Section 2, Sentence 3:** "RPY sticks levels vehicle." This specifies an *expected state change* (leveling) resulting from a specific input (RPY sticks centered).

* **Section 2, Sentence 4:** "Throttle (~50%) holds current altitude steady against wind." This describes an *expected post-action* (holding altitude) in a particular state (centered sticks).

* **Section 2, Sentence 6:** "Roll/Pitch sticks control tilt angle in respective orientations, resulting in corresponding left-right and forward-back movement." This specifies an *expected state change* (tilt and movement) based on control inputs.

* **Section 2, Sentence 7:** "Throttle stick controls up/down speed with a predetermined maximum rate (and movement speed in other axes)." This describes an *expected state change* (up/down speed) based on throttle input.

* **Section 2, Sentence 8:** "Yaw stick controls rate of angular rotation above the horizontal plane." This describes an *expected state change* (rotation rate) based on yaw stick input.

* **Section 2, Sentence 10:** "When landed, the vehicle will take off if the throttle stick is raised above 62.5% percent (of the full range from bottom)." This specifies a *state transition pre-requirement* (throttle above 62.5%) for the transition from landed to takeoff.

* **Section 2, Sentences 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18:** These sentences describe the autopilot assistance for Roll, Pitch, Throttle, and Yaw, specifying the *expected post-actions* of the system in response to stick positions.  These are important for understanding the system's behavior.


3. **Step 4: JSON Format:** The identified specifications are formatted according to the required JSON output structure.  Sentences deemed too general or descriptive, like those discussing wind effects or sensor types, were excluded as per the requirement for specific specifications.
