I'll go through the document step by step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications.

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey relevant information and should be annotated as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 1: Not a specification (general description)
- Sentence 2: Expected state change, should be annotated
- Sentences 3-5: Not specifications (general behavior descriptions)

Section 1:
- No sentences meet the criteria for specifications

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Not a specification (general description)
- Sentence 1: Not a specification (general behavior description)
- Sentences 2-4: Expected state changes, should be annotated
- Sentence 5: Not a specification (section header)
- Sentences 6-8: Expected state changes, should be annotated
- Sentence 9: Not a specification (section header)
- Sentence 10: State transition pre-requirement, should be annotated
- Sentence 11: Constraint, should be annotated
- Sentence 12: Expected state change, should be annotated
- Sentence 13: Constraint, should be annotated
- Sentences 14-18: Expected state changes, should be annotated

Step 4: I'll now format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the specified output format.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 14
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 16
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 17
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 18
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications, formatted according to the required JSON structure.
