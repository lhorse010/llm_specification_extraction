            "sentence-id": 13
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences are annotated because they convey specific information about the system's behavior, requirements, or constraints:
- Sentence-id 1 in section-id 0: Describes the expected state change when sticks are centered.
- Sentence-id 3 in section-id 2: Specifies the action of the RPY sticks when centered.
- Sentence-id 4 in section-id 2: Specifies the action of the throttle stick when centered.
- Sentence-id 10 in section-id 2: Defines the condition for takeoff, a state transition.
- Sentence-id 11 in section-id 2: Constrains altitude measurement under extreme weather.
- Sentence-id 13 in section-id 2: Specifies the need for manual control input, a fundamental constraint for the system's operation.
