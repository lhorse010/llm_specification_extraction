Let's go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

After careful analysis, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications:

1. Section 1, Sentence 0: State transition pre-requirement
2. Section 1, Sentence 1: State transition pre-requirement
3. Section 1, Sentence 4: Expected state change
4. Section 2, Sentence 7: Expected state change
5. Section 2, Sentence 11: Expected state change
6. Section 2, Sentence 16: Constraint
7. Section 2, Sentence 17: Expected state change
8. Section 2, Sentence 18: Expected state change
9. Section 2, Sentence 19: Expected state change
10. Section 2, Sentence 21: Expected state change
11. Section 6, Sentence 1: Constraint
12. Section 10, Sentence 2: Expected state change
13. Section 10, Sentence 4: Expected state change
14. Section 11, Sentence 1: Expected post-action
15. Section 11, Sentence 2: Expected state change
16. Section 11, Sentence 3: Expected state change

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 16
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 17
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 18
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 19
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 21
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 10,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 10,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 11,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 11,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 11,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ] 
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications as per our analysis.
