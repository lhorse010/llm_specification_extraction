Let's go through the document step by step and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the result of our analysis:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 14
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet our criteria for specifications:

1. They describe requirements for state transition (e.g., needing a valid local position estimate).
2. They specify constraints the system must adhere to (e.g., wind and flight time limits, minimum and maximum radius).
3. They detail expected post-actions when entering the Orbit state (e.g., flying to the closest point on the commanded circle trajectory).
4. They describe expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings (e.g., RC control changing orbit parameters).

The selected sentences are clear and specific, providing concrete information about the system's behavior, requirements, and limitations in the Orbit flight mode.
