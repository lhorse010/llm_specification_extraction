Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:
1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

Explanation:

* Section 0, Sentence 9: This sentence specifies the expected post-action of the system when entering a no drivable lane, which is to stop the vehicle before entering the lane or keep it stationary if autonomous mode started inside the lane.
* Section 0, Sentence 10: This sentence specifies the expected post-action of the system after stopping the vehicle, which is to ask the human driver to take the responsibility of the driving task.
* Section 1, Sentence 0: This sentence specifies the constraint for activating the function, which is when the lane id of the target path has a no drivable lane label.
* Section 2, Sentences 3-8: These sentences specify the expected state changes of the system in response to specific conditions, such as assigning the state to APPROACHING, INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE, or STOPPED based on the distance from the ego vehicle to the no drivable lane polygon and the stop margin.
