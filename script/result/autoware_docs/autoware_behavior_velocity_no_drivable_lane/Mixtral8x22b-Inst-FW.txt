After carefully reviewing the document, here are the annotated sentences as specifications:

```json
{
  "specifications": [
    {
      "section-id": 0,
      "sentence-id": 9
    },
    {
      "section-id": 0,
      "sentence-id": 10
    },
    {
      "section-id": 1,
      "sentence-id": 0
    },
    {
      "section-id": 2,
      "sentence-id": 2
    },
    {
      "section-id": 2,
      "sentence-id": 3
    },
    {
      "section-id": 2,
      "sentence-id": 4
    },
    {
      "section-id": 2,
      "sentence-id": 5
    },
    {
      "section-id": 2,
      "sentence-id": 6
    },
    {
      "section-id": 2,
      "sentence-id": 7
    },
    {
      "section-id": 2,
      "sentence-id": 8
    }
  ]
}
```

These sentences were annotated as specifications as they convey information about the system's requirements for state transition, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes.

1. The target of this module is to stop the vehicle before entering the no drivable lane (with configurable stop margin) or keep the vehicle stationary if autonomous mode started inside a no drivable lane. (Requirement for state transition)
2. Then ask the human driver to take the responsibility of the driving task (Takeover Request / Request to Intervene) (Expected post-action)
3. This function is activated when the lane id of the target path has an no drivable lane label (i.e. the no_drivable_lane attribute is yes). (Constraint)
4. Get the intersection points between path and no drivable lane polygon (Expected state change)
5. Assign the state to APPROACHING toward a no drivable lane if: the distance from front of the ego vehicle till the first intersection point between the ego path and the no drivable lane polygon is more than the stop_margin (Expected state change)
6. Assign the state to INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE if: the first point of the ego path is inside the no drivable lane polygon, or the distance from front of the ego vehicle till the first intersection point between the ego path and the no drivable lane polygon is less than the stop_margin (Expected state change)
7. Assign the state to STOPPED when the vehicle is completely stopped (Expected state change)

The rest of the sentences were not annotated as they did not provide clear and specific information related to the requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes.
