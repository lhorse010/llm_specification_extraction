**Reasoning:**

**Step 1: Reading the document:** The provided document describes a module responsible for handling situations where a planned path includes a "no drivable lane."

**Step 2 & 3: Categorizing and Annotating Sentences:**

* **Section 0 (Role):**
    * Sentence 1: Defines "no drivable lane," which acts as a *constraint* on the system's operation.  Annotated.
    * Sentence 8: Specifies how a lanelet is marked as "no drivable," which is a *state transition pre-requirement*. Annotated.
    * Sentence 9: Describes the *expected state change* of stopping before the lane or remaining stationary. Annotated.
    * Sentence 10: Specifies the *expected post-action* of requesting a takeover. Annotated.
    * Other sentences provide context or examples but don't specify requirements, constraints, post-actions, or state changes.

* **Section 1 (Activation Timing):**
    * Sentence 0: Defines the condition for activating the function, which is a *state transition pre-requirement*. Annotated.

* **Section 2 (Inner-workings / Algorithms):**
    * Sentence 4:  Specifies the condition for the "APPROACHING" state, which is a *state transition pre-requirement*. Annotated.
    * Sentence 6: Part of the condition for "INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE" state, a *state transition pre-requirement*. Annotated.
    * Sentence 7: Another part of the condition for "INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE" state, a *state transition pre-requirement*. Annotated.
    * Sentence 8: Defines the condition for the "STOPPED" state, which is a *state transition pre-requirement*. Annotated.
    * Other sentences describe algorithmic steps but don't directly specify conditions for state transitions.

* **Section 3 (Future Work):**
    * These sentences describe future plans, not current specifications.


**Step 4: Formatting in JSON:** The annotated sentences are formatted according to the specified JSON output format, including "section-id" and "sentence-id."
