I've carefully reviewed the document and identified the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Here's the annotated output in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet the criteria for specifications:

1. Section 0, Sentence 9: This describes the expected state changes and post-actions of the system in response to a no drivable lane.

2. Section 1, Sentence 0: This outlines a requirement for state transition, specifically when the function is activated.

3. Section 2, Sentence 4: This provides a constraint for the "APPROACHING" state transition.

4. Section 2, Sentences 6 and 7: These describe the conditions for transitioning to the "INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE" state.

5. Section 2, Sentence 8: This specifies the condition for transitioning to the "STOPPED" state.

These sentences provide clear, specific information about state transitions, constraints, and expected behaviors of the system, making them valid specifications according to the given criteria.
