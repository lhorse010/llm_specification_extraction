    ]
}
```

These sentences are annotated as specifications because they convey:
- State transition pre-requirements (e.g., "This function is activated when the lane id of the target path has a no_drivable_lane label...")
- Expected state changes (e.g., "Assign the state to APPROACHING...", "Assign the state to INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE if...")
- Constraints (e.g., the vehicle must stop before entering a no drivable lane with a configurable stop margin)
- Expected post-actions (e.g., "Then ask the human driver to take the responsibility of the driving task...")
