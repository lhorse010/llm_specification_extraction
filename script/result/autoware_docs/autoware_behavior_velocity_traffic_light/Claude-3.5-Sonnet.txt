I'll go through the document step by step to identify and annotate the sentences that match the given criteria for specifications.

Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
No sentences in this section meet the criteria for specifications.

Section 1:
No sentences in this section meet the criteria for specifications.

Section 2:
Sentence 0 describes a state transition pre-requirement, so it will be annotated.

Section 3:
Sentences 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, and 11 describe expected state changes or post-actions, so they will be annotated.

Section 4:
Sentences 4, 5, 8, and 9 describe expected state changes or constraints, so they will be annotated.

Step 4: I'll now format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the specified output format.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output contains all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. Each specification is represented by its section-id and sentence-id.
