**Reasoning:**

1. **Section 0 (Role):** These sentences describe the general purpose and design philosophy of the module but don't specify any state transitions, constraints, post-actions, or state changes.

2. **Section 1 (Limitations):** These sentences describe the limitations of the system but don't provide specific constraints in the context of state transitions or expected behavior.

3. **Section 2 (Activation Timing):** Sentence 0 ("This module is activated when there is traffic light in ego lane.") specifies a state transition pre-requirement (the presence of a traffic light in the ego lane).

4. **Section 3 (Algorithm):** This section contains multiple specifications:
    * Sentence 1 ("If a corresponding traffic light signal have never been found, it treats as a signal to pass.") specifies an expected state change (treating the situation as a "pass" signal).
    * Sentence 2 ("If a corresponding traffic light signal is found but timed out, it treats as a signal to stop.") specifies an expected state change (treating the situation as a "stop" signal).
    * Sentence 3 ("2.Uses the highest reliability one of the traffic light recognition result and if the color of that was not green or corresponding arrow signal, generates a stop point.") specifies an expected post-action (generating a stop point).
    * Sentence 4 ("If an elapsed time to receive stop signal is less than stop_time_hysteresis, it treats as a signal to pass.") specifies an expected state change (treating the situation as a "pass" signal).
    * Sentences 7 and 8 specify expected state changes based on vehicle velocity.
    * Sentences 10 and 11 specify expected state changes based on the ability to pass through the stop line during a yellow light.

5. **Section 4 (Dilemma Zone):** This section also contains specifications:
    * Sentence 4 ("vehicle can’t pass through stop line during yellow lamp.(right side of the yellow lamp line)") specifies a constraint related to the dilemma zone.
    * Sentence 5 ("vehicle can’t stop under deceleration and jerk limit.(left side of the pass judge curve)⇒emergency stop(relax deceleration and jerk limitation in order to observe the traffic regulation)") specifies a constraint and an expected state change (emergency stop).
    * Sentences 8 and 9 provide conditions and expected actions within the "optional zone," describing constraints and state changes.


Sentences like "This feature is to prevent chattering" or definitions of "yellow lamp line," "dilemma zone," and "optional zone" are descriptive and don't directly specify requirements, constraints, post-actions, or state changes.  Therefore, they are not included in the final JSON output.
