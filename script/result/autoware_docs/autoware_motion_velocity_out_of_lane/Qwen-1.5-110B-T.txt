Based on the provided document, here are the sentences annotated as specifications:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences are chosen because they convey information about:
- Activation conditions (requirement for state transition).
- Constraints on the system's behavior based on parameters (launch_out_of_lane_module).
- Expected post-actions (decisions to slow down or stop based on specific conditions).
- Expected state changes (calculation of stop or slowdown points, handling of trajectory changes).

Other sentences provide context or describe the internal workings of the system but do not directly specify requirements, constraints, post-actions, or state changes in the context of the given categories.
