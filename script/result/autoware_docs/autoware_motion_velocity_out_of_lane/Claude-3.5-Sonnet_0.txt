Let's go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I've read through the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

After careful analysis, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 9,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 9,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they clearly describe requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or state changes that the system must adhere to or perform. They provide specific information about how the system should behave under certain conditions or in response to particular settings.
