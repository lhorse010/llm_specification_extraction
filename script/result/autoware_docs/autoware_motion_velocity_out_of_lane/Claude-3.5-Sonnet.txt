I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON as per the output format.

Here's the result:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 9,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 9,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 9,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet the criteria for specifications:

1. They describe requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. They outline constraints the system must adhere to.
3. They explain expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. They detail expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

The selected sentences are clear and specific, providing concrete information about the system's behavior, requirements, and constraints.
