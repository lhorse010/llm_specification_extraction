Let's go through the document step by step and identify the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

After careful analysis, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications based on our criteria:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 9,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 9,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they clearly describe requirements for state transitions, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, or expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings. They are specific and provide clear information about the system's behavior and requirements.
