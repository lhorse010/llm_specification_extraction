I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I've read through the entire document about the Altitude Hold Mode.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

Here are the sentences I've identified as specifications:

Section 1, Sentence 0: Describes expected state behavior.
Section 3, Sentences 1-3: Describe expected state changes based on throttle position.
Section 3, Sentence 6: Describes a constraint (deadband size).
Section 3, Sentence 7: Describes a constraint (parameter range).
Section 4, Sentence 4: Describes a constraint (ratio of P to I).
Section 7, Sentence 2: Describes a constraint (ideal hover throttle).

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences I've identified as specifications based on the given criteria. These sentences describe requirements for state transitions, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, or expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings.
