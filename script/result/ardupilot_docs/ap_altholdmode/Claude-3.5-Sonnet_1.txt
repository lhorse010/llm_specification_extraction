I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Here's the step-by-step process:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll go through each section and sentence, determining if they meet the criteria for specifications and annotating them accordingly.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON as per the output format.

Here's the result of the analysis:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet one or more of the criteria for specifications:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition
2. Constraints the system must adhere to
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings

The selected sentences provide clear and specific information about how the Altitude Hold Mode functions, its controls, constraints, and expected behaviors. Vague or general informational sentences were excluded.
