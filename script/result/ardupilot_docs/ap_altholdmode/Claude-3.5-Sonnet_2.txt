I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
Step 2-3: Identify and annotate sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes.
Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here are the sentences I've identified as specifications:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they clearly describe requirements for state transitions, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, or expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings. The other sentences in the document were either too vague, provided general information, or did not fit the criteria for specifications as defined in the objective.
