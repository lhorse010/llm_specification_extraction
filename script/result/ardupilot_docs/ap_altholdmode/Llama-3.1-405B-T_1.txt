After carefully reading the document and following the steps outlined, I have annotated the sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. Here is the output in JSON format:

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 0, Sentence 0: "In altitude hold mode, Copter maintains a consistent altitude while allowing roll, pitch, and yaw to be controlled normally." (Expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 0: "When altitude hold mode (aka AltHold) is selected, the throttle is automatically controlled to maintain the current altitude." (Expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 1: "Roll, Pitch and yaw operate the same as in Stabilize mode meaning that the pilot directly controls the roll and pitch lean angles and the heading." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 0: "The autopilot uses a barometer which measures air pressure as the primary means for determining altitude (\"Pressure Altitude\") and if the air pressure is changing in your flight area due to extreme weather, the copter will follow the air pressure change rather than actual altitude." (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 1: "When fitted and enabled, a downward facing rangefinder such as LiDAR or SONAR will automatically provide even more accurate  altitude maintenance, up to the limit of the sensor." (Expected state change)
* Section 3, Sentences 0-9: These sentences describe the control behavior of the copter in altitude hold mode, including the response to throttle stick input and the effects of various parameters. (Expected post-actions and state changes)
* Section 4, Sentences 0-5: These sentences describe the tuning parameters for altitude hold mode and their effects on the copter's behavior. (Expected post-actions and state changes)
* Section 6, Sentences 3, 5, 10, 14, 15, and 18: These sentences describe common problems that may occur in altitude hold mode and their solutions. (Constraints and expected state changes)
* Section 7, Sentences 0-2: These sentences describe the importance of adequate power for the copter and the consequences of insufficient power. (Constraints)
* Section 8, Sentence 0: This sentence warns about the effect of expo on the transmitter on the altitude hold throttle dead band. (Constraint)
