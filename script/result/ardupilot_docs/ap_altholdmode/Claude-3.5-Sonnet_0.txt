I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences that meet the specification criteria. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(I've read the entire document)

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the result of the analysis:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet one or more of the criteria for specifications:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition
2. Constraints the system must adhere to
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings

The selected sentences provide clear and specific information about how the altitude hold mode operates, its constraints, and expected behaviors in response to user inputs or system states.
