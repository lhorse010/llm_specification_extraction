Based on the document provided, here are the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition:
- "When altitude hold mode (aka AltHold) is selected, the throttle is automatically controlled to maintain the current altitude." (section-id: 1, sentence-id: 0)
- "The pilot can control the climb or descent rate of the vehicle with the throttle stick." (section-id: 3, sentence-id: 0)
- "These speeds can be adjusted with the PILOT_SPEED_UP and PILOT_SPEED_DN parameters." (section-id: 3, sentence-id: 4)
- "The Altitude Hold P is used to convert the altitude error (the difference between the desired altitude and the actual altitude) to a desired climb or descent rate." (section-id: 4, sentence-id: 0)

2. Constraints the system must adhere to:
- "The autopilot uses a barometer which measures air pressure as the primary means for determining altitude (\"Pressure Altitude\") and if the air pressure is changing in your flight area due to extreme weather, the copter will follow the air pressure change rather than actual altitude." (section-id: 2, sentence-id: 0)
- "When fitted and enabled, a downward facing rangefinder such as LiDAR or SONAR will automatically provide even more accurate  altitude maintenance, up to the limit of the sensor." (section-id: 2, sentence-id: 1)
- "If the throttle stick is in the middle (40% ~ 60%) the vehicle will maintain the current altitude." (section-id: 3, sentence-id: 1)
- "Outside of the mid-throttle deadzone (i.e. below 40% or above 60%) the vehicle will descend or climb depending upon the deflection of the stick." (section-id: 3, sentence-id: 2)
- "The size of the deadband can be adjusted with the THR_DZ parameter." (section-id: 3, sentence-id: 6)
- "The 1:2 ratio of P to I (i.e. I is twice the size of P) should be maintained if you modify these parameters." (section-id: 4, sentence-id: 4)
- "These values should never be increased but for very powerful copters you may get better response by reducing both by 50% (i.e P to 0.5, I to 1.0)." (section-id: 4, sentence-id: 5)
- "It is very important that the vehicle has enough power available." (section-id: 7, sentence-id: 0)
- "If you incorporate expo on your transmitter, that directly increases the size of the Alt Hold throttle dead band." (section-id: 8, sentence-id: 0)

3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state:
- "Automatic altitude hold is a feature of many other flight modes (Loiter, Sport, etc) so the information here pertains to those modes as well." (section-id: 1, sentence-id: 2)
- "When disarming, the copter may need to rest in the landing position for a few seconds to allow the \"landing checker\" to verify that the copter has landed before you are able to disarm." (section-id: 3, sentence-id: 10)

4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings:
- "Roll, Pitch and yaw operate the same as in Stabilize mode meaning that the pilot directly controls the roll and pitch lean angles and the heading." (section-id: 1, sentence-id: 1)
- "Copter allows arming and disarming in altitude hold mode." (section-id: 3, sentence-id: 9)
