**Reasoning:**

**Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.** The provided document describes the Altitude Hold Mode for a copter, detailing its functionality, controls, tuning, common problems, and power requirements.

**Step 2 & 3: Categorize and Annotate Sentences.**  Each sentence was evaluated against the four specified categories:

* **State Transition Pre-requirement:** Conditions required *before* a state transition can occur.  There are no clear examples of this in the document.  While some sentences describe situations *before* actions happen (like climbing rapidly before entering AltHold), they are describing the context for issues, not pre-requirements for entering the mode itself.
* **Constraint:** Restrictions on the system's operation. Sentences like "The 1:2 ratio of P to I should be maintained..." (section 4, sentence 4) are constraints on tuning parameters.  "Ideally the vehicle should be able to hover at about 50% throttle..." (section 7, sentence 2) is a constraint on power.
* **Expected Post-action:** Actions the system takes *after* entering a specific state or receiving a command.  Many sentences describe what the system *does* in Altitude Hold mode, like maintaining altitude (section 1, sentence 0) or responding to throttle stick movements (section 3, sentences 0-3).  These are classified as expected post-actions.
* **Expected State Change:** Changes in the system's state in response to commands or settings.  Sentences describing how the system reacts to throttle input (section 3, sentences 1-3) fall into this category.  Arming and disarming (section 3, sentence 9) are also state changes.

**Step 4: Format the Annotated Sentences in JSON.**  The final JSON output lists the `section-id` and `sentence-id` of each sentence identified as a specification according to the criteria above.  Sentences providing general information, describing problems, or suggesting troubleshooting steps were excluded, as they don't directly specify system behavior.  Vague sentences like "This page contains important information..." were also excluded.
