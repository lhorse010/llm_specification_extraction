**Reasoning:**

**Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.**  The provided document describes the Altitude Hold Mode for a copter, explaining its functionality, controls, tuning, common problems, and power requirements.

**Step 2 & 3: Categorize and Annotate Sentences:**

* **Section 1, Sentence 0:** "When altitude hold mode (aka AltHold) is selected, the throttle is automatically controlled to maintain the current altitude." - This describes an *expected state change* upon entering AltHold mode (throttle becomes automatically controlled). Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 1, Sentence 1:**  "Roll, Pitch and yaw operate the same as in Stabilize mode meaning that the pilot directly controls the roll and pitch lean angles and the heading." - This describes the *expected behavior* of roll, pitch, and yaw in AltHold mode.  Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 3, Sentence 0:** "The pilot can control the climb or descent rate of the vehicle with the throttle stick." - This describes how the system should *respond* to pilot input (throttle stick).  Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 3, Sentence 1:** "1.If the throttle stick is in the middle (40% ~ 60%) the vehicle will maintain the current altitude." - This describes an *expected state change* (maintain altitude) based on a specific condition (throttle stick position). Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 3, Sentence 2:** "2.Outside of the mid-throttle deadzone (i.e. below 40% or above 60%) the vehicle will descend or climb depending upon the deflection of the stick." - This describes an *expected state change* (descend or climb) based on a specific condition (throttle stick position). Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 3, Sentence 3:** "When the stick is completely down the copter will descend at 2.5m/s and if at the very top it will climb by 2.5m/s." - This describes the *expected behavior* (specific descent/climb rates) based on throttle stick position. Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 3, Sentence 9:** "Copter allows arming and disarming in altitude hold mode." - This specifies a *permitted action* within the AltHold mode. Therefore, it's a specification.

* **Section 3, Sentence 10:** "When disarming, the copter may need to rest in the landing position for a few seconds to allow the \"landing checker\" to verify that the copter has landed before you are able to disarm." - This describes the *expected behavior* of the system during disarming in AltHold mode. Therefore, it's a specification.

Other sentences provide contextual information, describe common problems, or discuss tuning parameters, but they don't directly specify requirements, constraints, post-actions, or state changes related to the core functionality of AltHold mode.

**Step 4: Format the Annotated Sentences in JSON.** The final JSON output is provided above, adhering to the specified format.
