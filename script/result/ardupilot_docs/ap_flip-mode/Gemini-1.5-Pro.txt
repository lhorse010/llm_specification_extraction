**Reasoning:**

**Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.**  The provided document describes the "Flip Mode" functionality for a vehicle, likely a drone. It details how the flip is initiated, the conditions for flipping, and the expected behavior during and after the flip.

**Step 2 & 3: Categorize and Annotate:**

* **Section 0:**
    * Sentence 0: "Vehicle will flip on its roll or pitch axis depending upon the pilot's roll and pitch stick position." - **Expected state change** based on pilot input.
    * Sentence 1: "Vehicle will rise for 1 second and then rapidly flip." - **Expected post-action** after initiating the flip.
    * Sentence 2: "The vehicle will not flip again until the switch is brought low and back to high." - **Constraint** on the flip action.
    * Sentence 3: "Give yourself at least 10m of altitude before trying flip for the first time!" - This is advice, not a system requirement or constraint.  It is excluded.

* **Section 1:**
    * Sentence 0: "Controls:" - This is a heading, not a specification. It is excluded.
    * Sentence 1: "1.An RCx_OPTION parameter must be set to \"Flip\" which is \"2\"" - **Pre-requirement** for enabling flip mode.
    * Sentence 2: "2.Pilot switches to Stabilize, Acro or AltHold flight mode and puts ch7/ch8 switch to ON position." - **Pre-requirement** to initiate a flip.
    * Sentence 3: "3.Vehicle will Roll right by default but if roll or pitch stick is held slightly left, forward or back it will flip in that direction." - **Expected state change** based on pilot input.
    * Sentence 4: "4.Vehicle should complete the roll within 2.5sec and will then return to the original flight mode it was in before flip was triggered." - **Expected post-action** after completing the flip.  Includes a timing constraint.
    * Sentence 5: "5.Pilot may manually exit flip by switching off ch7/ch8 or by moving roll stick to >40deg left or right." -  **Expected state change** allowing manual exit.
    * Sentence 6: "State machine approach:" - This is a heading, not a specification. It is excluded.
    * Sentence 7: "1.Flip_Start (while copter is leaning <45deg) : roll right at 400deg/sec, increase throttle" - **Expected post-action** upon entering the Flip_Start state.
    * Sentence 8: "2.Flip_Roll (while copter is between +45deg ~ -90) : roll right at 400deg/sec, reduce throttle" - **Expected post-action** upon entering the Flip_Roll state.
    * Sentence 9: "3.Flip_Recover (while copter is between -90deg and original target angle) : use earth frame angle controller to return vehicle to original attitude" - **Expected post-action** upon entering the Flip_Recover state.


**Step 4: Format the Annotated Sentences in JSON.** The final JSON output is presented above, listing the `section-id` and `sentence-id` of each identified specification.
