I'll analyze the document and annotate the sentences that meet the specified criteria. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I've read the entire document about the Flip Mode feature.

Step 2 & 3: Determine and annotate sentences that convey relevant information.

Section 0:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change
- Sentence 1: Expected post-action
- Sentence 2: Constraint
- Sentence 3: Not a specification (safety advice)

Section 1:
- Sentence 1: Constraint
- Sentence 2: State transition pre-requirement
- Sentence 3: Expected state change
- Sentence 4: Expected post-action and constraint
- Sentence 5: State transition pre-requirement
- Sentence 7: Expected state change
- Sentence 8: Expected state change
- Sentence 9: Expected state change

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. Each specification is represented by its section-id and sentence-id.
