I'll go through the document step by step, analyzing each sentence to determine if it qualifies as a specification based on the given criteria. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Completed)

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether each sentence conveys relevant information and annotate if necessary.

Section 0:
Sentence 0: Expected state change - annotate
Sentence 1: Expected post-action - annotate
Sentence 2: Constraint - annotate
Sentence 3: Not a specification (safety advice)

Section 1:
Sentence 0: Not a specification (header)
Sentence 1: Constraint - annotate
Sentence 2: Pre-requirement - annotate
Sentence 3: Expected state change - annotate
Sentence 4: Expected post-action and constraint - annotate
Sentence 5: Pre-requirement - annotate
Sentence 6: Not a specification (header)
Sentence 7: Expected state change - annotate
Sentence 8: Expected state change - annotate
Sentence 9: Expected state change - annotate

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. Each entry in the "specifications" array contains the "section-id" and "sentence-id" of the annotated sentence.
