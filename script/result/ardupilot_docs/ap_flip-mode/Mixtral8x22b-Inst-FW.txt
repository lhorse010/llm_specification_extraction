Explanation:
The sentences that have been annotated as specifications are as follows:

1. "Vehicle will rise for 1 second and then rapidly flip." - This sentence conveys an expected post-action the system will execute when entering a particular state.
2. "The vehicle will not flip again until the switch is brought low and back to high." - This sentence conveys a constraint the system must adhere to.
3. "An RCx_OPTION parameter must be set to 'Flip' which is '2'" - This sentence conveys a requirement the system must meet for state transition.
4. "Pilot switches to Stabilize, Acro or AltHold flight mode and puts ch7/ch8 switch to ON position" - This sentence conveys a requirement the system must meet for state transition.
5. "Vehicle should complete the roll within 2.5sec and will then return to the original flight mode it was in before flip was triggered" - This sentence conveys an expected state change the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.
6. "Pilot may manually exit flip by switching off ch7/ch8 or by moving roll stick to >40deg left or right" - This sentence conveys an expected post-action the system will execute when entering a particular state.
7. "Flip_Start (while copter is leaning <45deg) : roll right at 400deg/sec, increase throttle" - This sentence conveys an expected state change the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.
8. "Flip_Roll (while copter is between +45deg ~ -90) : roll right at 400deg/sec, reduce throttle" - This sentence conveys an expected state change the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.
9. "Flip_Recover (while copter is between -90deg and original target angle) : use earth frame angle controller to return vehicle to original attitude" - This sentence conveys an expected state change the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.
