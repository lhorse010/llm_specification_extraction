Explanation:
1. Vehicle will rise for 1 second and then rapidly flip. (Expected post-action)
2. The vehicle will not flip again until the switch is brought low and back to high. (Constraint)
3. An RCx_OPTION parameter must be set to "Flip" which is "2". (State transition pre-requirement)
4. Pilot switches to Stabilize, Acro or AltHold flight mode and puts ch7/ch8 switch to ON position. (State transition pre-requirement)
5. Vehicle will Roll right by default but if roll or pitch stick is held slightly left, forward or back it will flip in that direction. (Expected state change)
6. Vehicle should complete the roll within 2.5sec and will then return to the original flight mode it was in before flip was triggered. (Expected post-action)
7. Pilot may manually exit flip by switching off ch7/ch8 or by moving roll stick to >40deg left or right. (Expected post-action)
8. Flip_Start (while copter is leaning <45deg) : roll right at 400deg/sec, increase throttle. (Expected state change)
9. Flip_Roll (while copter is between +45deg ~ -90) : roll right at 400deg/sec, reduce throttle. (Expected state change)
10. Flip_Recover (while copter is between -90deg and original target angle) : use earth frame angle controller to return vehicle to original attitude. (Expected state change)
