**Reasoning:**

**Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.**  The provided document describes the "Flip Mode" feature for a vehicle, likely a drone or similar aircraft.  It details user actions, system behavior, and internal state machine logic.

**Step 2 & 3: Categorize and Annotate:**

* **Section 0:**
    * Sentence 0: **Specification (Expected State Change):** Describes how the vehicle will flip based on pilot input.
    * Sentence 1: **Specification (Expected State Change):** Describes the vehicle's ascent and flip action.
    * Sentence 2: **Specification (Constraint/Pre-requirement):**  Describes a condition that prevents repeated flips.
    * Sentence 3:  This is advice for the user, not a system specification.

* **Section 1:**
    * Sentence 0: "Controls:" is a heading, not a specification.
    * Sentence 1: **Specification (Pre-requirement):**  Defines a parameter setting required for flip mode.
    * Sentence 2: **Specification (Pre-requirement):** Defines the pilot's actions to activate flip mode.
    * Sentence 3: **Specification (Expected State Change):** Describes how pilot input affects flip direction.
    * Sentence 4: **Specification (Expected State Change/Post-action):** Describes the expected duration and post-flip behavior.
    * Sentence 5: **Specification (Expected State Change):** Describes how the pilot can manually exit flip mode.
    * Sentence 6: "State machine approach:" is a heading, not a specification.
    * Sentence 7: **Specification (Expected Post-action):** Describes actions within the "Flip_Start" state.
    * Sentence 8: **Specification (Expected Post-action):** Describes actions within the "Flip_Roll" state.
    * Sentence 9: **Specification (Expected Post-action):** Describes actions within the "Flip_Recover" state.

**Step 4: Format in JSON:** The final JSON output lists the `section-id` and `sentence-id` of each annotated sentence as required by the output format.
