**Reasoning:**

1. **Step 1 & 2: Analyze Section 0 "Flip Mode"**:
    * Sentence 0: "Vehicle will flip on its roll or pitch axis depending upon the pilot's roll and pitch stick position." - This describes an *expected state change* based on pilot input.
    * Sentence 1: "Vehicle will rise for 1 second and then rapidly flip." - This describes an *expected post-action* after initiating a flip.
    * Sentence 2: "The vehicle will not flip again until the switch is brought low and back to high." - This describes a *constraint* on the flip action.
    * Sentence 3: "Give yourself at least 10m of altitude before trying flip for the first time!" - This is advice, not a specification of the system's behavior.

2. **Step 1 & 2: Analyze Section 1 "Flip Mode State Machine"**:
    * Sentence 0: "Controls:" - This is a section heading, not a specification.
    * Sentence 1: "1.An RCx_OPTION parameter must be set to \"Flip\" which is \"2\"" - This is a *pre-requirement* (constraint) for enabling the flip mode.
    * Sentence 2: "2.Pilot switches to Stabilize, Acro or AltHold flight mode and puts ch7/ch8 switch to ON position" - This describes the steps required to initiate a flip, thus a *pre-requirement* for state transition.
    * Sentence 3: "3.Vehicle will Roll right by default but if roll or pitch stick is held slightly left, forward or back it will flip in that direction" - This describes an *expected state change* based on pilot input.
    * Sentence 4: "4.Vehicle should complete the roll within 2.5sec and will then return to the original flight mode it was in before flip was triggered" - This describes *expected post-actions* after initiating a flip and a *constraint* on the flip duration.
    * Sentence 5: "5.Pilot may manually exit flip by switching off ch7/ch8 or by moving roll stick to >40deg left or right" - This describes how to interrupt/exit the flip state, hence describing a *state transition* and conditions for it.
    * Sentence 6: "State machine approach:" - This is a section heading, not a specification.
    * Sentence 7: "1.Flip_Start (while copter is leaning <45deg) : roll right at 400deg/sec, increase throttle" - This describes an *expected post-action* upon entering the Flip_Start state.
    * Sentence 8: "2.Flip_Roll (while copter is between +45deg ~ -90) : roll right at 400deg/sec, reduce throttle" - This describes an *expected post-action* upon entering the Flip_Roll state.
    * Sentence 9: "3.Flip_Recover (while copter is between -90deg and original target angle) : use earth frame angle controller to return vehicle to original attitude" - This describes an *expected post-action* upon entering the Flip_Recover state.


3. **Step 3 & 4: Format the specifications in JSON**: The final JSON output includes the `section-id` and `sentence-id` of the sentences identified as specifications in the previous steps.
