I'll analyze the document and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll determine which sentences convey the required information and should be annotated as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 1: Expected post-action. Annotate.
- Sentence 2: Constraint. Annotate.
- Sentence 3: This is a safety recommendation, not a specification. Do not annotate.

Section 1:
- Sentence 0: Not a specification. Do not annotate.
- Sentence 1: Requirement for state transition. Annotate.
- Sentence 2: Requirement for state transition. Annotate.
- Sentence 3: Expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 4: Expected post-action and constraint. Annotate.
- Sentence 5: Expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 6: Not a specification. Do not annotate.
- Sentence 7: Expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 8: Expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 9: Expected state change. Annotate.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications as per the given instructions.
