These sentences are considered specifications as they convey requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes for the "Flip Mode" in the context of a vehicle's control system. Sentences like "Give yourself at least 10m of altitude before trying flip for the first time!" are not annotated as they are more of a recommendation or safety advice rather than a strict system specification.
