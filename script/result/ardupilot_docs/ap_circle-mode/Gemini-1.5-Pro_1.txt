**Reasoning:**

1. **Step 1 & 2: Read and Categorize:**  Each sentence was evaluated against the four categories (state transition pre-requirement, constraint, expected post-action, expected state change).  Sentences like "Think moving forward from an FPV perspective." were deemed not to fit any of the categories as they are explanatory rather than specifying system behavior.

2. **Step 3: Annotate Specifications:** Sentences describing how the system should behave under certain conditions (e.g., "Setting the CIRCLE_RADIUS to zero will cause the copter to...") were marked as specifications. Constraints on the system (e.g., "The vehicle may not achieve the desired rate if...") were also included.

3. **Step 4: Format in JSON:** The final output adheres to the specified JSON format, listing only the `section-id` and `sentence-id` of the sentences classified as specifications.  This provides a concise and structured representation of the extracted specifications.
