Let's go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I've read through the entire document about Circle Mode.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 0: Specifies expected state change (orbit point and vehicle orientation).
- Sentence 1: Specifies expected state change based on parameter setting.
- Sentence 2: Specifies how a parameter affects system behavior.
- Sentence 3: Specifies the meaning of parameter values.
- Sentence 4: Specifies a constraint on the system's behavior.
- Sentence 6: Specifies how a parameter setting affects system behavior.
- Sentence 7: Specifies how a parameter setting enables new system behavior.

Section 1:
No sentences in this section meet our criteria for specifications.

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Specifies how a parameter enables system behavior (for older versions).
- Sentence 1: Specifies how a parameter controls system behavior (for newer versions).
- Sentence 2: Specifies the effect of a parameter setting.
- Sentences 3, 5, 7, 8: Specify expected state changes based on user input.
- Sentence 11: Specifies a constraint on system behavior.
- Sentence 12: Specifies a constraint on system behavior during failsafe.
- Sentence 16: Specifies expected state change based on parameter setting.
- Sentence 17: Specifies expected state change based on parameter setting.
- Sentence 18: Specifies expected state change based on parameter setting.

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: Specifies constraints on pilot control and expected behavior.
- Sentence 1: Specifies constraints on pilot control and system behavior.
- Sentence 2: Specifies how a mission command affects system state.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json

        {
            "section-id": 2,

        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 16
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 17
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 18
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. These sentences describe requirements for state transitions, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, and expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings.
