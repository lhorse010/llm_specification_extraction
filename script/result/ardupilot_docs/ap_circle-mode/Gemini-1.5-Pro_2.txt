**Reasoning:**

1. **Step 1 & 2: Read and Categorize:** The document describes "Circle Mode" for a vehicle (likely a drone).  Each sentence was evaluated to determine if it specified a pre-requirement for state transition, a constraint on the system, a post-action upon entering the state, or a state change in response to a command.  Sentences like those in section 1 describing the general behavior of circle mode (orbiting, speed modification) were categorized as specifications.  Sentences providing additional context or explanation without specifying system behavior (e.g., "Think moving forward from an FPV perspective") were excluded.

2. **Step 3: Annotate:** Sentences meeting the criteria in Step 2 were marked for inclusion in the final JSON output.  For example, "Setting the CIRCLE_RADIUS to zero will cause the copter to simply stay in place and slowly rotate" describes a specific state change based on a setting, so it's included.

3. **Step 4: Format in JSON:**  The `specifications` array in the JSON output contains objects, each with the `section-id` and `sentence-id` of the sentences identified as specifications in the previous steps. This adheres strictly to the required output format.
