REASONING:

Step 1: The provided document describes the "Circle Mode" feature of a flight control system, detailing its behavior, parameters, and control options.

Step 2: Each sentence was analyzed in the context of the document to determine if it falls into the specified categories.  Sentences like "Think moving forward from an FPV perspective." were excluded as they don't describe system behavior.

Step 3: Sentences fitting the categories were marked as specifications. For example, "Circle will orbit a point located CIRCLE_RADIUS centimeters in front of the vehicle with the nose of the vehicle pointed at the center" describes an expected post-action (orbiting) and a constraint (nose pointed at the center) upon entering Circle Mode.

Step 4: The identified specifications were formatted into the required JSON structure, including "section-id" and "sentence-id" for each.
