Let's go through the document step by step and identify the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change (orbit behavior)
- Sentence 1: Expected state change (behavior when radius is zero)
- Sentence 2: Constraint (speed modification)
- Sentence 3: Expected state change (rotation direction)
- Sentence 4: Constraint (acceleration limitation)
- Sentence 6: Expected state change (dynamic rate adjustment)
- Sentence 7: Expected state change (stick adjustment of radius and speed)

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change (adjustment of radius and velocity)
- Sentence 1: Constraint (CIRCLE_OPTIONS parameter control)
- Sentence 2: Pre-requirement (bit 0 setting for stick adjustment)
- Sentences 3, 5, 7, 8: Expected state changes (stick control behaviors)
- Sentence 11: Constraint (roll stick rate changes inhibition)
- Sentence 12: Constraint (stick changes inhibition in radio failsafe)
- Sentence 16: Expected state change (facing direction based on bit 1)
- Sentence 17: Expected state change (circle center position based on bit 2)
- Sentence 18: Expected state change (mount ROI setting based on bit 3)

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: Constraint (pilot control limitations)
- Sentence 1: Expected state change (yaw control behavior)

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

            "sentence-id": 16
        },
        {
