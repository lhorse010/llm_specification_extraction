**Reasoning:**

1. **Step 1 & 2: Analysis of each sentence:**  Each sentence was evaluated to determine if it described pre-requirements for state transitions, constraints on the system, expected post-actions, or expected state changes. Sentences providing general information or descriptions without specific system behavior were excluded.

2. **Step 3: Annotation:** Sentences meeting the criteria were marked as specifications.  For example:

* *"Circle will orbit a point located CIRCLE_RADIUS centimeters in front of the vehicle..."* This specifies the expected post-action upon entering Circle Mode.
* *"Setting the CIRCLE_RADIUS to zero will cause the copter to simply stay in place..."* This specifies an expected state change based on a specific setting.
* *"The vehicle may not achieve the desired rate if this requires the acceleration...to surpass the maximum acceleration held in the WPNAV_ACCEL parameter..."* This is a constraint on the system's behavior.

3. **Step 4: JSON formatting:** The annotated sentences were formatted according to the specified output JSON structure, including "section-id" and "sentence-id".  Sentences like  "Think moving forward from an FPV perspective." were excluded as they don't describe system behavior.  Similarly, sentences discussing units (section ID 1) or explaining what a parameter *does* without specifying an outcome were also excluded.


This process ensures that the output JSON contains only sentences that clearly specify system behavior in terms of state transitions, constraints, post-actions, or state changes.
