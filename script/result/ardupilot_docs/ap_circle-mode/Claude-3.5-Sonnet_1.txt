Let's go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate the sentences that qualify as specifications based on the given criteria.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine and annotate sentences that convey specification information.

Section 0:
- Sentence 0: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 1: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 2: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 3: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 4: Conveys constraint. Annotate.
- Sentence 5: Not a specification.
- Sentence 6: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 7: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.

Section 1:
- No sentences qualify as specifications.

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 1: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 2: Not a specification (introduces the following points).
- Sentences 3-10: Convey expected state changes. Annotate.
- Sentence 11: Conveys constraint. Annotate.
- Sentence 12: Conveys constraint. Annotate.
- Sentences 13-15: Not specifications (informational).
- Sentence 16: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 17: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 18: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: Conveys constraint and expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 1: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 2: Conveys expected state change. Annotate.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.
