I'll analyze the document and annotate the sentences that meet the specified criteria. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey the required information and should be annotated as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 1: Not a specification (general description)
- Sentence 2: Expected state change
- Sentences 3-5: Not specifications (general behavior descriptions)

Section 1:
- No specifications (general descriptions and comparisons)

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Not a specification (general description)
- Sentence 1: Not a specification (general behavior description)
- Sentence 3: Expected state change
- Sentence 4: Expected post-action
- Sentence 6: Expected state change
- Sentence 7: Expected state change
- Sentence 8: Expected state change
- Sentence 10: Pre-requirement for state transition
- Sentence 11: Constraint
- Sentence 13: Constraint
- Sentences 14-18: Expected state changes

Step 4: Now, I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the output format.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 14
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 16
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 17
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 18
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications, following the required format.
