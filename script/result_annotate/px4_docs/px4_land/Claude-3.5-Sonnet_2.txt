I'll go through the document step by step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

Section 0:
Sentence 1: Conveys expected state change. Annotate as specification.
Sentence 2: Conveys expected post-action. Annotate as specification.

Section 1:
Sentence 1: Conveys constraint. Annotate as specification.
Sentence 2: Conveys requirement for state transition. Annotate as specification.
Sentence 3: Conveys constraint. Annotate as specification.
Sentence 4: Conveys expected state change. Annotate as specification.
Sentence 5: Conveys constraint. Annotate as specification.
Sentence 6: Not a specification (informational).
Sentence 7: Conveys expected state change. Annotate as specification.

Section 2:
Sentence 0: Redundant information, not specific enough. Skip.
Sentence 1: Conveys expected state change and post-action. Annotate as specification.
Sentence 2: Conveys expected state change. Annotate as specification.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

This output adheres to the required format and includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given instructions.
