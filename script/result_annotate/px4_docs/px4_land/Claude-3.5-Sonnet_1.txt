I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

Section 0:
- Sentence 1: Expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 2: Expected post-action. Annotate.

Section 1:
- Sentence 1: Not specific enough. Skip.
- Sentence 2: Requirement for state transition. Annotate.
- Sentence 3: Constraint. Annotate.
- Sentence 4: Expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 5: Constraint. Annotate.
- Sentence 6: Not a specification. Skip.
- Sentence 7: Expected state change. Annotate.
- Sentence 8: Not specific enough. Skip.

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Repeats information. Skip.
- Sentence 1: Expected state change and post-action. Annotate.
- Sentence 2: Expected state change. Annotate.

Step 4: Format all the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given objectives and requirements.
