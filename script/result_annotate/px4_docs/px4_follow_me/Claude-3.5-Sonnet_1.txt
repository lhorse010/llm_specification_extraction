Step 1: I have thoroughly read the document.

Step 2-4: Now, I'll go through each section and sentence to determine if they convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes. I'll annotate the relevant sentences and format them in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 8
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected as specifications because they meet the criteria of describing requirements for state transition, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, or expected state changes. They provide clear and specific information about the system's behavior in Follow-Me mode.
