I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications. I'll go through this step-by-step as requested.

Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON as per the output format.

Here's the result:

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 8
        }
    ] 
}
```

These sentences were selected because they clearly specify requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or state changes for the Follow-Me Mode system. They provide specific information about how the system should behave, what conditions must be met for certain operations, and what actions the system will take in response to specific inputs or situations.
