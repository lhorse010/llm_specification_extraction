I'll go through the document step-by-step and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Then, I'll format the results in the required JSON output.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

After careful analysis, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications:

1. Section 1, Sentence 1: State transition pre-requirement
2. Section 1, Sentence 2: Constraint
3. Section 1, Sentence 3: Constraint
4. Section 1, Sentence 4: Expected state change
5. Section 1, Sentence 5: Constraint
6. Section 1, Sentence 6: Constraint
7. Section 1, Sentence 7: Constraint
8. Section 2, Sentence 0: Expected state change
9. Section 2, Sentence 1: Expected state change
10. Section 6, Sentence 11: Expected state change
11. Section 6, Sentence 12: Expected state change
12. Section 6, Sentence 13: Expected state change
13. Section 8, Sentence 1: Expected state change
14. Section 8, Sentence 3: Expected state change
15. Section 8, Sentence 8: Expected state change

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {

            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 8
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output contains the list of specifications identified in the document, following the required format.
