I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I've read through the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate if appropriate.

Section 0:
Sentence 0: This describes an expected state change, so it's a specification.

Section 1:
No sentences in this section meet the criteria for specifications.

Section 2:
Sentence 0: This is a constraint, so it's a specification.
Sentence 1: This is a pre-requirement for state transition, so it's a specification.
Sentence 2: This is a constraint, so it's a specification.
Sentence 3: This is an expected state change, so it's a specification.
Sentence 4: This contains both a pre-requirement and a constraint, so it's a specification.
Sentence 5: This is a pre-requirement for state transition, so it's a specification.
Sentence 6: This is not specific enough to be considered a specification.
Sentence 7: This is an expected state change, so it's a specification.

Section 3:
Sentence 0: This is an expected state change, but it's redundant with Section 0, Sentence 0, so we'll exclude it.
Sentence 1: This is an expected post-action, so it's a specification.
Sentence 2: This is an expected state change, but it's redundant with Section 2, Sentence 7, so we'll exclude it.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given requirements.
