Let's go through the steps to annotate the sentences as specifications based on the given criteria.

Step 1: I have thoroughly read the document.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now categorize and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the result:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 16
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 18
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 19
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 21
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 10,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 10,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 11,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 11,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 11,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet the criteria for specifications:
1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition
2. Constraints the system must adhere to
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings

The selected sentences provide clear and specific information about the system's behavior, requirements, and constraints in the context of Mission Mode for Multicopters.
