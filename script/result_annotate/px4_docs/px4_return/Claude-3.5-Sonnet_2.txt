I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences as specifications based on the given criteria. Let's go through this step by step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the result:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet the criteria for specifications:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition
2. Constraints the system must adhere to
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings

The selected sentences provide clear and specific information about the system's behavior, requirements, and constraints in the Return Mode for Multicopters.
