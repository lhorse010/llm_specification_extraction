I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria. Here's the step-by-step process:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2: I'll now categorize sentences based on the given categories.

Step 3: I'll annotate sentences that fall into the specified categories.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON.

After careful analysis, here's the output in the required format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,

        {

            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet the criteria for specifications, including system requirements for state transition, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. The sentences provide clear and specific information about the system's behavior in Return Mode for Multicopters.
