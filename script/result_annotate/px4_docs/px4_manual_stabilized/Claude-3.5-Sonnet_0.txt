I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Here's the step-by-step process:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2: I'll determine which sentences convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes.

Step 3: I'll annotate the sentences that fall into these categories as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the output format.

After careful analysis, here are the specifications I've identified:

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 14
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 16
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 17
        }
    ] 
}
```

These sentences were selected because they describe specific requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or state changes in the Stabilized Mode for multicopters. They provide clear and specific information about how the system should behave in various situations, which is crucial for software engineering and quality assurance purposes.
