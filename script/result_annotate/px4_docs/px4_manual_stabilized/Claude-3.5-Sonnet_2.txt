Let's go through the steps to annotate the sentences as specifications based on the given criteria.

Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey information in the specified categories and should be annotated as specifications.

Step 4: Here's the formatted JSON output with the annotated sentences:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 14
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 16
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 17
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet the criteria for specifications:

1. They describe requirements for state transitions (e.g., "The _Stabilized_ manual mode stabilizes and levels the multicopter when the RC control sticks are centred.")
2. They outline constraints the system must adhere to (e.g., "Manual control input is required (such as RC control, joystick).")
3. They describe expected post-actions when entering a particular state (e.g., "The multicopter will level out and stop once the roll and pitch sticks are centered.")
4. They detail expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings (e.g., "Roll/Pitch sticks control tilt angle in those orientations, resulting in corresponding left-right and forward-back movement.")

The sentences that were not included either provided general information, examples, or were not specific enough to be considered clear specifications.
