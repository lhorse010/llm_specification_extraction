I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Here's the step-by-step process:

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
Step 2: Determine whether each sentence conveys information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes.
Step 3: Annotate sentences that fit these categories as specifications.
Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

After careful analysis, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 16,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 16,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 16,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they describe requirements for state transitions, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, or expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings. The selection process focused on clear and specific statements that fit the given criteria, excluding vague or general descriptions.
