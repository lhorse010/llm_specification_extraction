I'll go through the document step by step and identify sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Then, I'll format the results in the required JSON output.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
Step 2-3: Identify and categorize sentences as specifications.
Step 4: Format the results in JSON.

Here are the sentences I've identified as specifications:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 16,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 16,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 16,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they describe requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes of the system. They provide clear and specific information about how the path optimizer should function, including its behavior in different scenarios and how it handles various conditions.
