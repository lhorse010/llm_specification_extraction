I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
Step 2-4: Identify and annotate sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes.

Here's the result in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 16,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 16,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 16,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences have been identified as specifications based on the criteria provided. They describe requirements for state transitions, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, or expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings.
