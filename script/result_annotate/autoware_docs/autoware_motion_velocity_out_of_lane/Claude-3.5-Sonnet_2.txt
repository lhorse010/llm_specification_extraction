Let's go through the document step by step and identify the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document carefully.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 1 (Activation):
- Sentence 0: This is a specification as it describes a requirement for state transition (activation of the module).

Section 2 (Inner-workings / Algorithms):
- Sentence 1: This is a specification as it describes a constraint the system must adhere to.

Section 3 (Inner-workings / Algorithms : 1.Ego trajectory footprints):
- Sentence 1: This is a specification as it describes a constraint the system must adhere to.

Section 6 (Inner-workings / Algorithms : 4.Predicted objects filtering):
- Sentences 1-4: These are specifications as they describe constraints the system must adhere to.

Section 7 (Inner-workings / Algorithms : 5.Time to collisions):
- Sentences 1-3: These are specifications as they describe expected state changes and constraints.

Section 8 (Inner-workings / Algorithms : 6.Calculate the stop or slowdown point):
- Sentences 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9: These are specifications as they describe constraints and expected state changes.

Section 9 (Inner-workings / Algorithms : About stability of the stop/slowdown pose):
- Sentences 1, 2, 3: These are specifications as they describe constraints and expected state changes.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. These sentences describe requirements for state transitions, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, and expected state changes.
