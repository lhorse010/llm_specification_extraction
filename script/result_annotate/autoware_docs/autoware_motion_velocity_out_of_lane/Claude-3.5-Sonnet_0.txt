Let's go through the document step by step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document carefully.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

After analyzing the document, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications according to our criteria:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 9,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet one or more of the criteria for specifications:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition
2. Constraints the system must adhere to
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings

The selected sentences provide clear and specific information about system behavior, parameters, and conditions that affect the operation of the out-of-lane module.
