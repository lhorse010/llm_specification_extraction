I'll go through the document step by step and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly. (Done)

Step 2-4: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Here's the result in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 9,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 9,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet the criteria for specifications:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition
2. Constraints the system must adhere to
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings

The selected sentences provide clear and specific information about the system's behavior, constraints, and state changes based on various parameters and conditions.
