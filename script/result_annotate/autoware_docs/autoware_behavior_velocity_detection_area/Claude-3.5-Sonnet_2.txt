Certainly, I'll analyze the document and annotate the sentences that meet the specified criteria. Let's go through this step by step.

Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: Now, I'll determine which sentences convey information in the specified categories and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON as per the output format.

Here's the result:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation of the selections:

1. Section 0, Sentence 0: This sentence describes an expected state change and post-action when a specific condition is met.

2. Section 1, Sentence 0: This sentence specifies a requirement for the module's activation.

3. Section 2, Sentences 0-4: These sentences describe the algorithm's steps, which include state transitions, constraints, and expected actions.

4. Section 3, Sentence 2: This sentence describes a specific condition and the resulting system behavior, which can be considered an expected state change.

The other sentences in Section 3 were not included as they provide context or explanations rather than clear specifications.
