Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

The following sentences were annotated as specifications:

* Section 0, Sentence 0: "If pointcloud is detected in a detection area defined on a map, the stop planning will be executed at the predetermined point." (Expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 0: "This module is activated when there is a detection area on the target lane." (Requirement for state transition)
* Section 2, Sentence 0: "1.Gets a detection area and stop line from map information and confirms if there is pointcloud in the detection area" (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 1: "2.Inserts stop point l[m] in front of the stop line" (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 2: "3.Inserts a pass judge point to a point where the vehicle can stop with a max deceleration" (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 3: "4.Sets velocity as zero behind the stop line when the ego-vehicle is in front of the pass judge point" (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 4: "5.If the ego vehicle has passed the pass judge point already, it doesnâ€™t stop and pass through." (Expected state change)
* Section 3, Sentence 0: "If it needs X meters (e.g. 0.5 meters) to stop once the vehicle starts moving due to the poor vehicle control performance, the vehicle goes over the stopping position that should be strictly observed when the vehicle starts to moving in order to approach the near stop point (e.g. 0.3 meters away)." (Constraint)
* Section 3, Sentence 2: "If the vehicle is stopped within hold_stop_margin_distance meters from stop point of the module (\\_front_to_stop_line < hold_stop_margin_distance), the module judges that the vehicle has already stopped for the module's stop point and plans to keep stopping current position even if the vehicle is stopped due to other factors." (Expected state change)

The following sentences were not annotated as specifications:

* Section 3, Sentence 1: "This module has parameter hold_stop_margin_distance in order to prevent from these redundant restart." (This sentence provides additional information about the module's parameters, but it does not convey any information about state transitions, constraints, post-actions, or state changes.)
