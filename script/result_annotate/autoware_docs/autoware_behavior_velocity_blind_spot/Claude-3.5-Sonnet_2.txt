I'll go through the document step by step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- No sentences meet the criteria for specification.

Section 1:
- Sentence 0 describes a requirement for state transition, so it should be annotated.

Section 2:
- Sentence 0 describes expected post-actions, so it should be annotated.
- Sentences 1-4 provide more details about the post-actions but are not specific requirements or constraints, so they should not be annotated.
- Sentence 5 describes expected state changes and post-actions, so it should be annotated.
- Sentences 6-7 provide conditions for the state change mentioned in sentence 5, so they should be considered part of the same specification and not annotated separately.
- Sentence 8 describes a constraint, so it should be annotated.
- Sentence 9 describes expected state changes and a constraint, so it should be annotated.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the output in the required format:

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ] 
}
```

This output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications according to the given requirements.
