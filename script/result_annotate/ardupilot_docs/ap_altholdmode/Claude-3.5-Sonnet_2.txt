I'll go through the document step-by-step, analyzing each sentence to determine if it should be annotated as a specification based on the given criteria. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate if necessary.

Section 0:
No sentences qualify as specifications.

Section 1:
Sentence 0 describes an expected state change, so it will be annotated.

Section 2:
No sentences qualify as specifications.

Section 3:
Sentences 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 describe expected state changes or constraints, so they will be annotated.

Section 4:
No sentences qualify as specifications.

Section 5:
No sentences qualify as specifications.

Section 6:
No sentences qualify as clear and specific specifications.

Section 7:
Sentence 2 describes a constraint, so it will be annotated.

Section 8:
No sentences qualify as specifications.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria and requirements.
