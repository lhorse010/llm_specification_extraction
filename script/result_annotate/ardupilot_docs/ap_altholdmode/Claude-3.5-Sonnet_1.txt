I've read through the document and analyzed each sentence to determine if it conveys information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes. Based on this analysis, I've identified the sentences that qualify as specifications. Here's the JSON output with the annotated specifications:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they provide clear and specific information about system requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or state changes in the context of the Altitude Hold Mode for the copter system.
