Based on the provided document, I have annotated the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:
1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here is the output in JSON format:

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 0, Sentence 0: "In altitude hold mode, Copter maintains a consistent altitude while allowing roll, pitch, and yaw to be controlled normally." (Expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 0: "When altitude hold mode (aka AltHold) is selected, the throttle is automatically controlled to maintain the current altitude." (Expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 1: "Roll, Pitch and yaw operate the same as in Stabilize mode meaning that the pilot directly controls the roll and pitch lean angles and the heading." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 0: "The autopilot uses a barometer which measures air pressure as the primary means for determining altitude (\"Pressure Altitude\") and if the air pressure is changing in your flight area due to extreme weather, the copter will follow the air pressure change rather than actual altitude." (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 1: "When fitted and enabled, a downward facing rangefinder such as LiDAR or SONAR will automatically provide even more accurate  altitude maintenance, up to the limit of the sensor." (Expected state change)
* Section 3, Sentences 0-9: These sentences describe the control of the climb or descent rate of the vehicle with the throttle stick, which is an expected post-action. (Expected post-action)
* Section 4, Sentences 0-5: These sentences describe the tuning of the Altitude Hold P, Throttle Rate, and Throttle Accel PID gains, which are constraints. (Constraint)
* Section 6, Sentence 3: "Normally this is caused by not having the throttle stick in the mid position." (Constraint)
* Section 6, Sentence 5: "See the wiki page related to setting the mid throttle position." (Constraint)
* Section 6, Sentence 10: "The workaround is to enter AltHold while the copter is flying at a stable altitude." (Expected state change)
* Section 6, Sentence 14: "There is no cure for this behaviour at the moment although increasing the EK2_ALT_M_NSE parameter reduces  the effect but increases the change of Common Problem #1 listed above." (Constraint)
* Section 6, Sentence 15: "The EK2_ALT_M_NSE parameter has a range from 0.1 to 10.0 and allows increments of 0.1." (Constraint)
* Section 6, Sentence 18: "The solution is to move the autopilot out of the prop wash effect or shield it within an appropriately ventilated enclosure." (Constraint)
* Section 7, Sentences 0-2: These sentences describe the importance of having enough power available, which is a constraint. (Constraint)
* Section 8, Sentence 0: "If you incorporate expo on your transmitter, that directly increases the size of the Alt Hold throttle dead band." (Constraint)
