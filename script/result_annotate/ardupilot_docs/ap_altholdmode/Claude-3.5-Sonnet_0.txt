I'll go through the document step-by-step and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications. Then I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly. (Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 0: Describes expected state behavior. Annotate.

Section 1:
- Sentence 0: Describes expected state behavior. Annotate.
- Sentence 1: Describes expected state behavior. Annotate.

Section 3:
- Sentence 1: Describes expected state behavior. Annotate.
- Sentence 2: Describes expected state behavior. Annotate.
- Sentence 3: Describes system constraints. Annotate.
- Sentence 4: Describes system constraints. Annotate.
- Sentence 5: Describes system constraints. Annotate.
- Sentence 6: Describes system constraints. Annotate.
- Sentence 7: Describes system constraints. Annotate.
- Sentence 8: Describes system constraints. Annotate.
- Sentence 10: Describes expected post-action. Annotate.

Section 4:
- Sentence 4: Describes system constraints. Annotate.

Section 6:
- Sentence 8: Describes expected state behavior. Annotate.
- Sentence 9: Describes expected post-action. Annotate.
- Sentence 15: Describes system constraints. Annotate.

Section 7:
- Sentence 2: Describes system constraints. Annotate.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

This JSON output contains all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. These sentences describe requirements for state transitions, system constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes.
