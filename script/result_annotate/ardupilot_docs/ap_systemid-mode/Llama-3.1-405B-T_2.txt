To annotate the sentences as specifications, we will follow the steps outlined in the objective.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.

The document is about the System Identification Mode, which is for advanced users and provides a means to generate mathematical models of the vehicle's flight behavior.

Step 2: In context, determine whether a sentence conveys information in the following categories: "state transition pre-requirement", "constraint", "expected post-action", "expected state change", or determine whether it conveys no information in any of these categories.

Let's analyze each sentence:

Section 0:
- Sentence 0: This sentence provides a general description of the System Identification Mode. It does not convey any specific information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes. Therefore, it will not be annotated as a specification.
- Sentence 1: This sentence describes the behavior of the vehicle when in System Identification Mode. It mentions that the vehicle is placed into a STABILIZE like mode and generates bursts of signals. This sentence conveys information about expected post-actions when entering the System Identification Mode. Therefore, it will be annotated as a specification.

Section 1:
- Sentence 0: This sentence states that if the SID_AXIS is non-zero, then the mode's associated parameters will become visible, and entry into the mode will be allowed. This sentence conveys information about state transition pre-requirements. Therefore, it will be annotated as a specification.
- Sentence 1: This sentence states that if the SID_AXIS is zero, an error message will be logged, and mode entry will be prohibited. This sentence conveys information about expected post-actions in response to a specific condition. Therefore, it will be annotated as a specification.

Step 3: If a sentence is categorized as a pre-requirement, constraint, expected post-action, or expected state change, annotate it as a specification.

The annotated sentences are:

- Section 0, Sentence 1
- Section 1, Sentence 0
- Section 1, Sentence 1

Step 4: Format all the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here is the output in the required format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```
