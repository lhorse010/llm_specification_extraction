Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

Explanation:

* Sentence 3 in Section 0 describes an expected post-action: "When the user releases the sticks, the optical flow sensor is used by the autopilot to bring the vehicle to a stop."
* Sentences 7-12 in Section 0 describe parameters that can be used to tune FlowHold's performance, which are constraints the system must adhere to. These parameters include:
	+ FHLD_BRAKE_RATE: controls the desired deceleration rate when the pilot releases the sticks
	+ FHLD_FILT_HZ: filter applied to the optical flow sensor data
	+ FHLD_FLOW_MAX: optical flow sensor's maximum rate (in m/s) used when stopping
	+ FHLD_QUAL_MIN: minimum flow quality used
	+ FHLD_XY_P, FHLD_XY_I, FHLD_XY_IMAX, and FHLD_XY_FILT_HZ: gains to tune the stopping response

Note that sentences 0-2, 4-6 in Section 0, and sentences 0-1 in Section 1 do not convey any information about state transition requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, and are therefore not annotated as specifications.
