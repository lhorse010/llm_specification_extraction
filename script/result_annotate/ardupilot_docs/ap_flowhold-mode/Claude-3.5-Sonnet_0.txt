I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences as specifications based on the given criteria. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the analysis and resulting output:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 12
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation of the selected specifications:

1. Section 0, Sentence 3: This sentence describes an expected state change in response to user action, which fits criterion 4.

2. Section 0, Sentences 7-12: These sentences describe specific parameters that control the system's behavior, which can be considered as constraints (criterion 2) and expected state changes (criterion 4).

The other sentences in the document were not included as specifications because they either provide general information, descriptions, or recommendations, rather than specific requirements, constraints, or expected behaviors of the system.
