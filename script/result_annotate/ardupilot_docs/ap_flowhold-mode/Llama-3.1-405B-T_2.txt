Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 12
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

* Sentence 3 in Section 0 describes an expected post-action when the user releases the sticks.
* Sentences 7-12 in Section 0 describe parameters that can be used to tune FlowHold's performance, which are constraints the system must adhere to.

The other sentences do not convey information about state transition requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, so they are not annotated as specifications.
