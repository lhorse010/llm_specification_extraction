I will analyze the document and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey relevant information and should be annotated as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON as per the output format.

Here's the result:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 12
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet the criteria for specifications:

1. Section 1, Sentence 1: Describes expected state changes in response to user input.
2. Section 1, Sentence 3: Specifies a constraint on throttle control.
3. Section 2, Sentence 5: Describes an expected state change during turns.
4. Section 2, Sentence 6: Specifies expected state changes during turns.
5. Section 2, Sentence 7: Describes an expected outcome of the system's behavior.
6. Section 2, Sentence 8: Specifies an expected post-action when releasing controls.
7. Section 2, Sentence 9: Describes an expected state when controls are centered.
8. Section 2, Sentence 10: Specifies how throttle input affects the system and a constraint on motor behavior.
9. Section 2, Sentence 11: Specifies a system requirement (GPS dependency).
10. Section 2, Sentence 12: Describes expected state changes in response to GPS signal loss.

These sentences provide clear and specific information about system behavior, constraints, and expected actions, making them suitable as specifications for the Drift Mode feature.
