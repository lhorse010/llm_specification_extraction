I'll go through the document step by step and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 2, Sentence 1: Expected state change
Section 2, Sentence 1: Constraint

Section 3, Sentence 1: Expected state change
Section 3, Sentence 4: Expected state change
Section 3, Sentence 5: Expected state change
Section 3, Sentence 6: Expected state change and constraint
Section 3, Sentence 8: Expected post-action

Section 7, Sentence 0: Constraint
Section 7, Sentence 1: Constraint
Section 7, Sentence 2: Expected state change
Section 7, Sentence 3: Constraint

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. These sentences describe requirements for state transitions, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes in the context of the Stabilize Mode for the vehicle control system.
