Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 12
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

* Sentence 1 is annotated as a specification because it conveys a requirement for the system to receive the lead vehicle's position through a telemetry system.
* Sentence 2 is annotated as a specification because it conveys an expected post-action of the system to hold its current altitude when the sticks are placed within 10% of mid-throttle.
* Sentence 3 is annotated as a specification because it conveys an expected state change of the system to climb or descend at up to 2.5m/s.
* Sentence 4 is annotated as a specification because it conveys a constraint on the acceleration used to establish the speeds.
* Sentence 8 is annotated as a specification because it conveys a constraint on the maximum distance from the lead vehicle before giving up on following and holding position.
* Sentence 12 is annotated as a specification because it conveys a constraint on the gain that controls how aggressively the vehicle moves towards the lead vehicle.

The other sentences are not annotated as specifications because they either provide general information or describe parameters that can be used to tune the system's performance, but do not convey specific requirements, constraints, or expected state changes.
