I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I've read the entire document about Sport Mode.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- No sentences meet the criteria for specifications.

Section 1:
- No sentences meet the criteria for specifications. These sentences provide information about the availability of the mode but don't describe system requirements, constraints, or expected behaviors.

Section 2:
Sentence 1: Not a specification. It's a description of the mode's purpose.
Sentence 2: This is a specification. It describes expected state changes in response to pilot inputs.
Sentence 3: This is a specification. It describes a constraint the system must adhere to.
Sentence 4: This is a specification. It describes expected state changes and constraints.
Sentence 5: This is a specification. It describes constraints on the system's behavior.
Sentence 6: This is a specification. It describes a constraint on the system's behavior.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given objectives and requirements.
