Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2-4: After analyzing the document, I have identified the sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. Here's the JSON output with the annotated specifications:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 18
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 17
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 19
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 6
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences have been identified as specifications because they convey information about requirements for state transition, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, or expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings related to the RTL (Return To Launch) mode in the copter system.
