Let's go through the document step by step and identify the sentences that qualify as specifications based on the given criteria.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(I have read the entire document)

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 1: No specifications found.

Section 2:
- Sentence 2: Constraint (Simple and Super Simple modes can be used with most flight modes except Acro and Drift)
- Sentence 3: Expected state change (Simple Mode controls the copter relative to its heading at takeoff)
- Sentence 4 & 5: Expected state change (Super Simple Mode controls the copter relative to its direction from home)
- Sentence 6: Expected state change (Modes can be assigned to flight mode switch positions or enabled/disabled from Ch7/Ch8 switches)

Section 3: No specifications found.

Section 4:
- Sentence 4: Expected state change (With full right roll, the vehicle will fly a circle clockwise around the pilot)
- Sentence 5: Pre-requirement (Super Simple mode requires GPS lock)
- Sentence 5: Constraint (Ensure GPS lock before take-off)
- Sentence 6: Constraint (Orientation is not updated when the vehicle is within 10m of home)

Section 5:
- Sentence 1: Expected state change (Transmitter's auxiliary channels can be set up to enable selection of Simple mode, Super Simple mode, or both)
- Sentence 2: Constraint (Only one auxiliary channel should be set for these modes)
- Sentence 2: Expected state change (This channel will override the simple/super-simple options selected on the Flight Modes screen)
- Sentence 3: Expected state change (For selection of one mode, assign the mode to a channel mapped to a 2-position switch)
- Sentence 4: Expected state change (To enable both modes, select Super Simple mode for a channel mapped to a 3-position switch)

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 4
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output contains the list of sentences that qualify as specifications based on the given criteria. These sentences describe requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes related to the Simple and Super Simple modes of the copter system.
