Let's go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

After careful analysis, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications:

1. Section 1, Sentence 2: This sentence describes constraints the system must adhere to (Simple and Super Simple modes can be used with most flight modes except Acro and Drift).

2. Section 1, Sentence 3: This sentence describes requirements for state transition (Simple Mode requires a good compass heading).

3. Section 1, Sentence 5: This sentence describes requirements for state transition (Super Simple Mode requires a good GPS position).

4. Section 1, Sentence 6: This sentence describes expected state changes in response to specific settings (modes can be assigned to switch positions or enabled/disabled from specific switches).

5. Section 4, Sentence 4: This sentence describes a constraint the system must adhere to (Super Simple mode requires GPS lock before take-off).

6. Section 4, Sentence 5: This sentence describes a constraint the system must adhere to (orientation is not updated within 10m of home).

7. Section 5, Sentence 1: This sentence describes expected state changes in response to specific settings (transmitter's auxiliary channels can be set up to enable selection of Simple mode, Super Simple mode or both).

8. Section 5, Sentence 2: This sentence describes a constraint the system must adhere to (only one auxiliary channel should be set for these modes, overriding other options).

9. Section 5, Sentence 3: This sentence describes expected state changes in response to specific settings (assigning a mode to a 2-position switch channel).

10. Section 5, Sentence 4: This sentence describes expected state changes in response to specific settings (enabling both modes from a 3-position switch channel).

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 5,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

This output adheres to the required format and includes only the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications as outlined in the objective.
