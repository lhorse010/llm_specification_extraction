Let's go through this step-by-step to annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document about the Brake Mode.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 1: Not a specification (general description)
- Sentence 2: Specification (constraint)
- Sentence 3: Specification (requirement for state transition)
- Sentence 4: Specification (constraint)
- Sentence 5: Not a specification (suggestion, not a requirement)
- Sentence 6: Not a specification (example, not a requirement)

Section 1:
- Sentence 0: Not a specification (general description)
- Sentence 1: Not a specification (general information, not a specific requirement)
- Sentence 2: Specification (expected state change)

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Specification (constraint)
- Sentence 1: Specification (constraint)

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ] 
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications, following the required format.
