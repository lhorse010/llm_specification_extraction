Based on the provided document, I have annotated the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here is the output in the required JSON format:

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 0, Sentence 2: "1.A two or preferably three position auxiliary switch is set to \"ZigZag SaveWP\" (i.e. RC7_OPTION = 61)" (State transition pre-requirement)
* Section 0, Sentence 3: "2.The pilot arms the vehicle in Loiter mode, takes off and then changes to ZigZag mode (in the future we may make it possible to arm and take-off in ZigZag mode)" (State transition pre-requirement)
* Section 0, Sentence 4: "3.The vehicle is flown manually (it flies like Loiter) to one side of the field and then the auxiliary switch is moved to the highest or lowest position (it doesn't matter which) to record that side" (Expected post-action)
* Section 0, Sentence 5: "4.The vehicle is flown to the other side of the field and the switch is moved to the opposite position" (Expected post-action)
* Section 0, Sentence 6: "5.The switch can now be used to start the vehicle flying autonomously (at the current height) to either side of the field." (Expected state change)
* Section 0, Sentence 7: "Once the vehicle reaches the other side it will revert to manual control." (Expected state change)
* Section 0, Sentence 8: "The pilot can also regain manual control by moving the auxiliary switch to the middle position or by changing the flight mode." (Expected state change)
* Section 0, Sentence 10: "If the range finder becomes unhealthy while traversing from one side to the other, the vehicle will revert to manual control and come to a stop." (Constraint)
* Section 0, Sentence 11: "When flown manually ZigZag uses Loiter mode's parameters." (Constraint)
* Section 0, Sentence 13: "When autonomously flying from one side of the field to the other, the Auto mode parameters are used." (Constraint)
* Section 1, Sentence 0: "ZigZag is available in Copter-4.0 (and higher)" (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 0: "After the field's side points are registered, if you have an RC switch configured with RCx_OPTION = 83 (ZigZag Auto Mode), you can automatically cover the field side to side at a programmable distance interval, also enabling a sprayer, if equipped." (State transition pre-requirement)
* Section 2, Sentence 2: "1.Fly to one side of the field and register the ZigZagWP A, as above, then fly to ZigZagWP B and set it." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 3: "2.Then switch the ZigZag Auto Mode switch you had setup." (Expected post-action)
* Section 2, Sentence 6: "3.Upon activation, the vehicle will move in ZIGZ_DIRECTION with respect to its heading for ZIGZ_SIDE_DIST, then proceed to cross the field until the opposite ZigZagWP is reached." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 7: "It will then wait for ZIGZ_WP_DELAY to allow sprayer to fully stop and then move ZIGZ_SIDE_DIST down the side of the field again to proceed back across the area." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 8: "It will do this for ZIGZ_LINE_NUM times (-1 = infinite until switched out of this mode, =0 will only move to the first field crossing position, but not proceed further)." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 9: "Moving the ZigZag Auto switch to the low position immediately stops this mode and returns to normal ZIGZAG mode." (Expected state change)
* Section 3, Sentence 0: "This feature will be available in Copter-4.1.0" (Constraint)
* Section 3, Sentence 1: "this function must be enabled with ZIGZ_AUTO_ENABLE = 1, and parameters reloaded, before any parameters are visible and the feature enabled." (Constraint)
