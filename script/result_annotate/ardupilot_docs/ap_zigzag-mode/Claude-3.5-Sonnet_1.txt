I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document about ZigZag Mode.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 2: Expected state change
- Sentence 3: Pre-requirement for state transition
- Sentence 4: Expected state change and constraint
- Sentence 6: Expected state change
- Sentence 7: Expected state change
- Sentence 8: Expected state change
- Sentence 9: Expected post-action
- Sentence 10: Expected state change
- Sentence 11: Constraint
- Sentence 13: Constraint

Section 2:
- Sentence 6: Expected state change
- Sentence 7: Expected post-action
- Sentence 8: Constraint
- Sentence 9: Expected state change

Section 3:
- Sentence 1: Constraint

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output contains the annotated sentences that meet the criteria for specifications, following the required output format.
