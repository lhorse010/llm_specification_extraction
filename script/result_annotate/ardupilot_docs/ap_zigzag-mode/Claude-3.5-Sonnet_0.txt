I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document about ZigZag Mode.

Step 2 & 3: Determine and annotate sentences that convey specification information.

Section 0:
- Sentence 2: State transition pre-requirement
- Sentence 3: State transition pre-requirement and expected state change
- Sentence 4: Expected post-action
- Sentence 6: Expected state change
- Sentence 7: Expected state change
- Sentence 8: Expected state change
- Sentence 9: Constraint
- Sentence 10: Expected state change
- Sentence 11: Constraint
- Sentence 13: Constraint

Section 2:
- Sentence 6: Expected state change
- Sentence 7: Expected post-action
- Sentence 8: Constraint
- Sentence 9: Expected state change

Section 3:
- Sentence 1: Constraint

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output contains all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. These sentences describe state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes for the ZigZag Mode system.
