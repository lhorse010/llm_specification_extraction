I've carefully read through the document and analyzed each sentence based on the given criteria. Here's the JSON output with the annotated specifications:

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ] 
}
```

These sentences were selected as specifications because they meet one or more of the criteria:

1. Requirements for state transition
2. Constraints the system must adhere to
3. Expected post-actions when entering a particular state
4. Expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings

The selected sentences provide clear and specific information about how the ZigZag mode operates, including state transitions, constraints, and expected behaviors in various scenarios.
