After carefully reading the document and following the steps outlined, I have identified the sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences convey the following information:

* Section 0, Sentence 2: Requirement for setting the auxiliary switch to "ZigZag SaveWP" (i.e., RC7_OPTION = 61) to enter ZigZag mode.
* Section 0, Sentence 3: Requirement for arming the vehicle in Loiter mode and taking off before changing to ZigZag mode.
* Section 0, Sentence 4: Expected post-action of flying the vehicle manually to one side of the field and recording that side by moving the auxiliary switch to the highest or lowest position.
* Section 0, Sentence 5: Expected post-action of flying the vehicle to the other side of the field and recording that side by moving the auxiliary switch to the opposite position.
* Section 0, Sentence 6: Expected state change of the vehicle flying autonomously to either side of the field when the auxiliary switch is moved to the highest or lowest position.
* Section 0, Sentence 7: Expected state change of the vehicle reverting to manual control when it reaches the other side of the field.
* Section 0, Sentence 8: Expected post-action of regaining manual control by moving the auxiliary switch to the middle position or changing the flight mode.
* Section 0, Sentence 10: Constraint of the vehicle reverting to manual control and coming to a stop if the range finder becomes unhealthy while traversing from one side to the other.
* Section 2, Sentence 2: Requirement for flying to one side of the field and registering the ZigZagWP A, then flying to ZigZagWP B and setting it.
* Section 2, Sentence 3: Expected post-action of switching the ZigZag Auto Mode switch to start automatic operation.
* Section 2, Sentence 6: Expected state change of the vehicle moving in ZIGZ_DIRECTION with respect to its heading for ZIGZ_SIDE_DIST, then proceeding to cross the field until the opposite ZigZagWP is reached.
* Section 2, Sentence 7: Expected post-action of waiting for ZIGZ_WP_DELAY to allow the sprayer to fully stop, then moving ZIGZ_SIDE_DIST down the side of the field again to proceed back across the area.
* Section 2, Sentence 8: Expected state change of the vehicle repeating the process for ZIGZ_LINE_NUM times.
* Section 2, Sentence 9: Expected post-action of stopping the automatic operation by moving the ZigZag Auto switch to the low position.
* Section 3, Sentence 1: Constraint of enabling the ZIGZ_AUTO_ENABLE parameter and reloading parameters before using the automatic operation feature.
