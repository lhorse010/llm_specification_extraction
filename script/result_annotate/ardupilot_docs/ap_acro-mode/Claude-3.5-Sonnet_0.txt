Let's go through the document step by step and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 1: Expected state change
- Sentence 5: Expected state change (when ACRO_OPTIONS bit 1 is set)

Section 1:
- Sentence 0: Constraint
- Sentence 1: Expected state change
- Sentence 4: Constraint

Section 2:
- Sentence 2: Requirement for state transition

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change

Section 4:
- Sentences 3-4: Expected state change
- Sentences 8-9: Constraint and expected state change
- Sentences 10-12: Expected state changes based on switch positions

Section 5:
- Sentences 3-5: Expected state change when ACRO_BAL_ROLL and ACRO_BAL_PITCH are non-zero

Section 6:
- Sentence 0: Constraint

Section 7:
- Sentences 0-2: Expected state change based on ACRO_RP_RATE
- Sentences 3-4: Expected state change based on ACRO_Y_RATE
- Sentences 5-7: Expected state change based on ACRO_RP_EXPO and ACRO_Y_EXPO

Section 8:
- Sentences 3-9: Expected state change based on ATC_ACCEL_R_MAX and ATC_ACCEL_P_MAX
- Sentences 10-11: Expected state change based on ATC_ACCEL_Y_MAX
- Sentences 12-13: Expected state change based on ATC_THR_MIX_MAN

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.
