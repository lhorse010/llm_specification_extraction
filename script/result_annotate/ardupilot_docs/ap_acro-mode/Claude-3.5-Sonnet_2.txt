Let's go through the document step by step and identify the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 1: Expected state change
- Sentence 5: Expected state change (for pure rate mode)

Section 1:
- Sentence 0: Constraint
- Sentence 1: Expected state change
- Sentence 4: Expected state change

Section 2:
- Sentence 2: Pre-requirement

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change

Section 4:
- Sentences 3-4: Expected state change
- Sentences 8-9: Expected state change and constraint
- Sentence 11: Expected state change

Section 5:
- Sentences 3-5: Expected state change

Section 6:
- Sentence 0: Constraint

Section 7:
- Sentences 0-2: Expected state change
- Sentences 3-4: Expected state change

Section 8:
- Sentences 3-8: Expected state change
- Sentences 10-11: Expected state change
- Sentence 13: Expected state change

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.
