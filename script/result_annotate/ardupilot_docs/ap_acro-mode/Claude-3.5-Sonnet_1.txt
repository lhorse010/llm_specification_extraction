Let's go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

After careful analysis, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications:

1. Section 0, Sentence 1: State transition requirement
2. Section 0, Sentence 1: Expected state change
3. Section 0, Sentence 5: Expected state change
4. Section 1, Sentence 0: Constraint
5. Section 1, Sentence 1: Expected state change
6. Section 4, Sentence 4: Expected post-action
7. Section 4, Sentence 9: Constraint
8. Section 7, Sentence 0: Expected state change
9. Section 7, Sentence 3: Expected state change

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the output in the required format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

This output meets the requirements by including only clear and specific sentences that describe requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes related to the system's behavior in Acro mode.
