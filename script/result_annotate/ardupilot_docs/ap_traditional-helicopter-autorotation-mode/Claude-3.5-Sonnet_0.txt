I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Identify and annotate sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes.

Identified specifications:

1. Section 1, Sentence 0: "This flight mode is available for traditional helicopters only." (Constraint)
2. Section 1, Sentence 1: "It is currently limited to single rotor helicopters." (Constraint)
3. Section 2, Sentence 1: "This is only enabled for use with SITL." (Constraint)
4. Section 6, Sentence 12: "As this manoeuvre is flown close to the ground it requires a reliable height estimate that can account for the local terrain." (Requirement for state transition)
5. Section 6, Sentence 13: "Downward facing LiDaR is therefore highly recommended." (Constraint)
6. Section 8, Sentence 1: "When exiting the autonomous autorotation flight mode the aircraft will be returned to a \"non-manual collective mode\"." (Expected state change)
7. Section 8, Sentence 3: "When initiated, the bail-out phase will read the requested climb or descent rate from the operators throttle stick position." (Expected post-action)
8. Section 8, Sentence 4: "The aircraft will then be decelerated over a set period of time (see parameter AROT_BAIL_TIME)." (Expected post-action)
9. Section 9, Sentence 0: "The motor ramp time defined by H_RSC_RAMP_TIME is ignored during bail-out, and a hard-coded ramp time of one second is used." (Constraint)
10. Section 12, Sentence 0: "The autonomous autorotation flight mode cannot be entered via a mode switch, as is done with other flight modes." (Constraint)
11. Section 12, Sentence 1: "In an attempt to mimic the autorotation procedure followed when flying a manual autorotation, the mode is entered and exited using the motor interlock switch." (Requirement for state transition)
12. Section 12, Sentence 2: "The autonomous flight mode can only be entered if the interlock is disengaged whilst flying in a non-manual collective mode." (Requirement for state transition)
13. Section 12, Sentence 3: "When exiting the autorotation the flight mode is returned to the mode from which it came (e.g. Altitude Hold -> Autonomous Autorotation -> Altitude Hold)." (Expected state change)
14. Section 12, Sentence 5: "In which case, the mode is exited into Altitude Hold." (Expected state change)

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.
