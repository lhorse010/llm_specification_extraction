I'll go through the document step by step, identifying sentences that meet the criteria for specifications, and then provide the output in the required JSON format.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

After careful analysis, I've identified the following sentences as specifications:

Section 1, Sentence 0: "This flight mode is available for traditional helicopters only."
Section 1, Sentence 1: "It is currently limited to single rotor helicopters."
Section 2, Sentence 1: "This is only enabled for use with SITL."
Section 2, Sentence 2: "Do not attempt to use this flight mode in real life."
Section 6, Sentence 12: "As this manoeuvre is flown close to the ground it requires a reliable height estimate that can account for the local terrain."
Section 6, Sentence 13: "Downward facing LiDaR is therefore highly recommended."
Section 9, Sentence 0: "The motor ramp time defined by H_RSC_RAMP_TIME is ignored during bail-out, and a hard-coded ramp time of one second is used."
Section 12, Sentence 0: "The autonomous autorotation flight mode cannot be entered via a mode switch, as is done with other flight modes."
Section 12, Sentence 1: "In an attempt to mimic the autorotation procedure followed when flying a manual autorotation, the mode is entered and exited using the motor interlock switch."
Section 12, Sentence 2: "The autonomous flight mode can only be entered if the interlock is disengaged whilst flying in a non-manual collective mode."
Section 12, Sentence 3: "When exiting the autorotation the flight mode is returned to the mode from which it came (e.g. Altitude Hold -> Autonomous Autorotation -> Altitude Hold)."
Section 12, Sentence 4: "The only exception to this is when the aircraft enters the autorotation from an auto mission."
Section 12, Sentence 5: "In which case, the mode is exited into Altitude Hold."

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 6,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 9,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 12,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 12,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 12,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 12,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 12,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 12,
            "sentence-id": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications, formatted according to the required JSON structure.
