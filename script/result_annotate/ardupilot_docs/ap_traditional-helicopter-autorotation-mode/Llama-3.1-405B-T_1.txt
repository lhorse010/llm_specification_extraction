After carefully reading the document, I have annotated the sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. Here is the output in JSON format:

```json

  ]

```

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 1, Sentence 0: "This flight mode is available for traditional helicopters only." (Constraint)
* Section 1, Sentence 1: "It is currently limited to single rotor helicopters." (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 0: "This is an ongoing development project." (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 1: "This is only enabled for use with SITL." (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 2: "Do not attempt to use this flight mode in real life." (Constraint)
* Section 4, Sentence 6: "It is this reversal of the vertical velocity that necessitates careful collective management when entering the autorotation." (Expected post-action)
* Section 4, Sentence 8: "It is key that the collective is moved proportionally to the direction of the resultant velocity vector to minimize the blade drag generated, preventing excessive loss of head speed." (Expected post-action)
* Section 5, Sentence 2: "It is important to maintain aircraft energy as efficiently as possible in the glide phase so that the maximum amount of energy is available for the flare and touch-down phase." (Expected post-action)
* Section 6, Sentence 12: "As this manoeuvre is flown close to the ground it requires a reliable height estimate that can account for the local terrain." (Constraint)
* Section 8, Sentence 2: "The aircraft will then be decelerated over a set period of time (see parameter AROT_BAIL_TIME)." (Expected state change)
* Section 8, Sentence 3: "At the end of which, the requested vertical speed will match the magnitude requested on the stick." (Expected state change)
* Section 8, Sentence 4: "The time spent in this phase is typically of the order of two seconds." (Expected state change)
* Section 10, Sentence 0: "The motor ramp time defined by H_RSC_RAMP_TIME is ignored during bail-out, and a hard-coded ramp time of one second is used." (Constraint)
* Section 10, Sentence 1: "It often takes ArduCopter a second to register that the aircraft has landed once on the ground." (Constraint)
* Section 10, Sentence 2: "Therefore, if the interlock is re-engaged immediately after the aircraft touches down the one second ramp time of the bail-out phase can be initiated on the ground." (Constraint)
* Section 10, Sentence 3: "Caution is therefore required when running autorotations in quick succession to prevent rapid rotor spool up on ground." (Constraint)
* Section 12, Sentence 2: "The autonomous flight mode can only be entered if the interlock is disengaged whilst flying in a non-manual collective mode." (State transition pre-requirement)
* Section 12, Sentence 3: "When exiting the autorotation the flight mode is returned to the mode from which it came (e.g. Altitude Hold -> Autonomous Autorotation -> Altitude Hold)." (Expected state change)
* Section 12, Sentence 4: "The only exception to this is when the aircraft enters the autorotation from an auto mission." (Expected state change)
* Section 12, Sentence 5: "In which case, the mode is exited into Altitude Hold." (Expected state change)
