After carefully analyzing the document, I have identified the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Here's the annotated output in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they meet the criteria for specifications, describing requirements for state transitions, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes in the Land Mode of the copter system.
