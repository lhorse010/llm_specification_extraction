I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: Let's analyze each sentence and determine if it should be annotated as a specification:

Section 0:
- No sentences qualify as specifications.

Section 1:
- Sentence 2: This is an expected state change. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 4: This is an expected state change. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 5: This is an expected state change. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 6: This is an expected state change. It should be annotated.

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: This is a constraint. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 1: This is a constraint. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 2: This is a pre-requirement. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 3: This is a constraint. It should be annotated.

Step 4: Now, I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the output format.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

This output adheres to the required format and includes all sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria.
