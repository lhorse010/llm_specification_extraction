After carefully reading the document and following the steps outlined, I have identified the sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

The annotated sentences are:

* Section 1, Sentence 2: "If a transmitter switch is used with  RCx_OPTION ARM/DISARM with Airmode (option 154) and used to arm, then stabilization at idle throttle is still fully active, which is often referred to as AIRMODE." (Expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 4: "Setting an RC channel to RCx_OPTION = 84, allows enabling or disabling AIRMODE in ACRO and STABILIZE modes directly." (Expected state change)
* Section 1, Sentence 5: "In addition, setting bit 0 of ACRO_OPTIONS will activate AIRMODE in ACRO mode (only) all the time, except if overridden by the above switch, if used." (Expected state change)
* Section 2, Sentence 0: "to avoid enabling AIRMODE but still use an ARM/DISARM switch, use Auxiliary function option \"153\" for the switch." (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 1: "AIRMODE has no effect in Traditional Helicopter" (Constraint)
* Section 2, Sentence 2: "It isn't sufficient to just enable arming on an RCx_OPTION switch, you also have to actually use it for arming." (State transition pre-requirement)
* Section 2, Sentence 3: "So if you have it on a switch but then use rudder-arming then you won't get \"airmode\"." (Expected post-action)
