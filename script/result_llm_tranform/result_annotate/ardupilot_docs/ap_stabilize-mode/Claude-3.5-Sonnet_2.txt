I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

Section 2:
- Sentence 1: This is an expected state change. It should be annotated.

Section 3:
- Sentence 1: This is a constraint. It should be annotated.

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: This describes expected state changes. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 1: This describes an expected state change. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 3: This describes an expected state change. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 4: This describes an expected state change. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 5: This describes an expected state change. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 6: This describes expected state changes. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 8: This describes an expected state change. It should be annotated.

Section 7:
- Sentence 0: This describes a constraint. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 1: This describes a constraint. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 2: This describes a constraint. It should be annotated.
- Sentence 3: This describes an expected state change. It should be annotated.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given objectives.
