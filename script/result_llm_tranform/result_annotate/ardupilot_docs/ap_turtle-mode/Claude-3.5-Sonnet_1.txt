I'll go through the document step by step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now analyze each sentence and categorize it if it meets the criteria for a specification.

Section 0:

Sentence 2: Constraint
Sentence 3: Requirement for state transition
Sentence 4: Requirement for state transition
Sentence 8: Requirement for state transition
Sentence 9: Expected post-action
Sentence 10: Expected state change
Sentence 11: Expected state change
Sentence 12: Constraint

Section 1:

Sentence 0: Constraint

Step 4: I'll now format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given categories.
