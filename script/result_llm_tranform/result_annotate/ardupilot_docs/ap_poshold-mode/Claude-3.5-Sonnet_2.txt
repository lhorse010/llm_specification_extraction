I'll analyze the document and annotate the sentences that meet the specified criteria. Let's go through this step-by-step.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document about the PosHold mode.

Step 2 & 3: Determine and annotate sentences that convey relevant information.

Section 0:
No sentences meet the criteria.

Section 1:
Sentence 0: This is an expected state change when entering PosHold mode.
Sentence 1: This is a constraint for good performance.

Section 2:
Sentence 5: This is a pre-requirement for arming in PosHold mode.
Sentence 8: This is a constraint on the maximum brake-angle.
Sentence 9: This is a constraint on the rotation speed.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications as per the given objectives and requirements.
