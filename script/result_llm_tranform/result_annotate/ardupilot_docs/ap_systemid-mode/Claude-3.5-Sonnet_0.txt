Let's go through this step by step:

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document carefully.

Step 2: Determine whether sentences convey information in the specified categories.

Step 3: Annotate sentences that fall into these categories as specifications.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Now, let's analyze each sentence:

Section 0:
Sentence 0: This is a general description, not a specification.
Sentence 1: This describes expected state changes and post-actions, so it should be annotated.

Section 1:
Sentence 0: This describes a requirement for state transition and expected state changes, so it should be annotated.
Sentence 1: This describes an expected post-action, so it should be annotated.

Based on this analysis, here's the JSON output:

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ] 
}
```

This output adheres to the required format and includes only the sentences that clearly specify requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes.
