Let's go through this step by step:

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the document, which contains information about a System Identification Mode for a vehicle control system.

Step 2: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information.
Let's analyze each sentence:

Section 0:
Sentence 0: This is a general description, not a specification.
Sentence 1: This describes expected state changes and post-actions, so it's a specification.

Section 1:
Sentence 0: This describes a pre-requirement for state transition, so it's a specification.
Sentence 1: This describes an expected post-action, so it's a specification.

Step 3: Annotate sentences categorized as specifications.
Based on our analysis, we'll annotate sentences 0-1 and 1-0, 1-1 as specifications.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the output in the required format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

This output identifies three sentences as specifications, following the given criteria and format requirements.
