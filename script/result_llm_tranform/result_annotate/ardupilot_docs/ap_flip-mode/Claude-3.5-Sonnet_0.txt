I'll analyze the document and annotate the sentences that meet the specified criteria. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey the required information and should be annotated as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change
- Sentence 1: Expected post-action
- Sentence 2: Constraint
- Sentence 3: This is a safety recommendation, not a specification

Section 1:
- Sentence 1: Pre-requirement
- Sentence 2: Pre-requirement
- Sentence 3: Expected state change
- Sentence 4: Constraint and expected post-action
- Sentence 5: Expected state change
- Sentence 7: Expected state change
- Sentence 8: Expected state change
- Sentence 9: Expected state change

Step 4: Now, I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the output format.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications, following the required format. The sentences selected provide clear and specific information about state transitions, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes in the context of the Flip Mode feature.
