Let's go through this step-by-step to annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document carefully.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Going through each section:

Section 0:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change
- Sentence 1: Expected state change
- Sentence 2: Expected state change
- Sentence 4: Constraint
- Sentence 6: Expected state change
- Sentence 7: Expected state change

Section 1:
No sentences meet our criteria.

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change (for older versions)
- Sentence 1: Expected state change (for newer versions)
- Sentence 2: Expected state change
- Sentences 3, 5, 7, 8: Expected state changes
- Sentence 11: Constraint
- Sentence 12: Constraint
- Sentence 16: Expected state change
- Sentence 17: Expected state change
- Sentence 18: Expected state change

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: Constraint and expected state change
- Sentence 1: Expected state change and constraint
- Sentence 2: Expected state change

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 16
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 17
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 18
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. These sentences describe requirements for state transitions, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, and expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings.
