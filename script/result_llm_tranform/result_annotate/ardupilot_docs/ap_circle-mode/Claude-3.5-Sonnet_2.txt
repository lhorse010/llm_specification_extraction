Let's go through the steps to annotate the sentences as specifications based on the given criteria.

Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: Let's analyze each sentence and determine if it should be annotated as a specification:

Section 0:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change - Annotate
- Sentence 1: Expected state change - Annotate
- Sentence 2: Expected state change - Annotate
- Sentence 3: Constraint - Annotate
- Sentence 4: Constraint - Annotate
- Sentences 5-7: These describe methods to adjust settings, but don't directly fit the criteria - Do not annotate

Section 1:
- Sentences 0-1: These are informational and don't fit the criteria - Do not annotate

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: This is historical information - Do not annotate
- Sentence 1: This introduces a parameter but doesn't specify behavior - Do not annotate
- Sentence 2: This introduces a condition for the following specifications - Do not annotate
- Sentences 3, 5, 7, 8: Expected state changes - Annotate
- Sentences 4, 6: These are explanatory and don't fit the criteria - Do not annotate
- Sentences 9-10: Expected state changes - Annotate
- Sentences 11-15: These are informational and don't fit the criteria - Do not annotate
- Sentence 16: Expected state change - Annotate
- Sentence 17: Expected state change - Annotate
- Sentence 18: Expected post-action - Annotate

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: Constraint - Annotate
- Sentence 1: Expected state change and constraint - Annotate
- Sentence 2: This is informational and doesn't fit the criteria - Do not annotate

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 16
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 17
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 18
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

This output follows the required format and includes all sentences that were determined to be specifications based on the given criteria.
