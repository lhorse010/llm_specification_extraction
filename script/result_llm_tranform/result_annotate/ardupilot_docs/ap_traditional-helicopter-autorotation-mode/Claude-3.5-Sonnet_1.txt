Let's go through the document step by step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document carefully.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

After careful analysis, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications:

1. Section 1, Sentence 0: This describes a constraint on the system.
2. Section 1, Sentence 1: This also describes a constraint on the system.
3. Section 2, Sentence 1: This is a constraint on the system's usage.
4. Section 2, Sentence 2: This is a strong constraint on the system's usage.
5. Section 7, Sentence 2: This describes an expected post-action when entering the touch-down state.
6. Section 8, Sentence 1: This describes an expected state change in response to specific conditions.
7. Section 8, Sentence 3: This describes an expected post-action when exiting the autorotation mode.
8. Section 8, Sentence 4: This describes an expected state change in response to a specific command.
9. Section 9, Sentence 0: This describes an expected state change in response to a specific setting.
10. Section 12, Sentence 0: This describes a constraint on mode entry.
11. Section 12, Sentence 2: This describes a requirement for state transition.
12. Section 12, Sentence 3: This describes an expected state change when exiting the mode.
13. Section 12, Sentence 5: This describes an expected state change in a specific scenario.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 7,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 8,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 9,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 12,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 12,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 12,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 12,
            "sentence-id": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

This output adheres to the required format and includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications as defined in the task.
