I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes, and annotate them as specifications.

Sentence 0: This is a general description, not a specification.
Sentence 1: This is a pre-requirement for the Follow mode to function. [Specification]
Sentence 2: This describes an expected state change and post-action. [Specification]
Sentence 3: This describes a constraint and expected behavior. [Specification]
Sentence 4: This describes how a parameter affects behavior, which is an expected state change. [Specification]
Sentence 5: This is an introductory sentence, not a specification.
Sentence 6: This describes a pre-requirement for enabling Follow mode. [Specification]
Sentence 7: This describes how a parameter affects behavior, which is an expected state change. [Specification]
Sentence 8: This describes a constraint and expected behavior. [Specification]
Sentence 9: This describes how parameters affect behavior, which are expected state changes. [Specification]
Sentence 10: This describes how a parameter affects behavior, which is an expected state change. [Specification]
Sentence 11: This describes how a parameter affects behavior, which is an expected state change. [Specification]
Sentence 12: This describes how a parameter affects behavior, which is an expected state change. [Specification]
Sentence 13: This describes how a parameter affects behavior, which is an expected state change. [Specification]
Sentence 14: This describes how a parameter affects behavior, which is an expected state change. [Specification]

Step 4: Now I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the specified output format.

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 14
        }
    ] 
}
```

This output adheres to the specified format and includes all sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria.
