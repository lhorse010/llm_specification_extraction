After carefully reading the document and following the steps outlined, I have identified the sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were chosen because they convey specific information about the requirements and behavior of the system:

* Section 1, Sentence 2: Describes the condition under which stabilization at idle throttle is still fully active.
* Section 1, Sentence 4: Describes how to enable or disable AIRMODE in ACRO and STABILIZE modes directly.
* Section 1, Sentence 5: Describes how to activate AIRMODE in ACRO mode all the time, except if overridden by a switch.
* Section 2, Sentence 0: Provides a note on how to avoid enabling AIRMODE but still use an ARM/DISARM switch.
* Section 2, Sentence 1: States that AIRMODE has no effect in Traditional Helicopter.
* Section 2, Sentence 2: Clarifies that it's not sufficient to just enable arming on an RCx_OPTION switch, but it must also be used for arming.
* Section 2, Sentence 3: Describes the consequence of not using the RCx_OPTION switch for arming.
