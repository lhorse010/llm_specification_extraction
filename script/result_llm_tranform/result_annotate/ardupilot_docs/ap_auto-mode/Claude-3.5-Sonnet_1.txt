I understand. I'll go through the document step by step, identify sentences that match the criteria for specifications, and then format the results in JSON as requested. Let's begin:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now go through each section and sentence, determining if they meet the criteria for specifications and annotating them accordingly.

Section 0:
No sentences meet the criteria for specifications.

Section 1:
Sentences 0, 1, and 2 describe expected state changes and constraints, so they are specifications.
Sentence 4 describes requirements for state transition, so it is a specification.

Section 2:
Sentences 0 and 1 describe expected state changes, so they are specifications.
Sentence 2 describes a constraint, so it is a specification.

Section 3:
Sentences 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 describe requirements for state transition or expected state changes, so they are specifications.

Section 4:
Sentence 0 describes expected state changes and constraints, so it is a specification.

Section 5:
Sentences 2, 3, and 4 describe expected state changes or post-actions, so they are specifications.

Section 6:
Sentences 7, 8, 9, and 10 describe constraints and expected state changes, so they are specifications.

Step 4: Now, I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON according to the specified output format.

```json

    ]
}
```

This JSON output contains all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. Each specification is represented by its section-id and sentence-id.
