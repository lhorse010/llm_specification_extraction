I'll go through the document step-by-step and annotate sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read through the entire document.

Step 2 & 3: Determine which sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 1 (section-id: 1):
- Sentence 1: Expected state change
- Sentence 2: Expected state change
- Sentence 3: Expected state change

Section 2 (section-id: 2):
- Sentence 2: Expected state change
- Sentence 3: Expected state change
- Sentence 4: Expected state change
- Sentence 5: Expected state change
- Sentence 6: Expected state change
- Sentence 8: Expected state change
- Sentence 9: Expected state change
- Sentence 10: Constraint
- Sentence 11: Constraint
- Sentence 12: Expected state change

Section 4 (section-id: 4):
- Sentence 0: Pre-requirement for state transition

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 12
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that were identified as specifications based on the given criteria. These sentences describe requirements for state transitions, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, and expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings.
