I'll go through the document step by step and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey relevant information and should be annotated as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 1: Not a specification (general description)
- Sentence 2: Expected state change, annotate
- Sentences 3-5: Not specifications (general behavior descriptions)

Section 1:
- No specifications (general descriptions)

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Not a specification (general description)
- Sentence 1: Not a specification (general behavior description)
- Sentence 2: Not a specification (heading)
- Sentence 3: Expected state change, annotate
- Sentence 4: Expected post-action, annotate
- Sentence 5: Not a specification (heading)
- Sentence 6: Expected state change, annotate
- Sentence 7: Expected state change, annotate
- Sentence 8: Expected state change, annotate
- Sentence 9: Not a specification (heading)
- Sentence 10: State transition pre-requirement, annotate
- Sentence 11: Not a specification (general information)
- Sentence 12: Not a specification (general information)
- Sentence 13: Constraint, annotate
- Sentence 14: Expected post-action, annotate
- Sentence 15: Expected state change, annotate
- Sentence 16: Expected post-action, annotate
- Sentence 17: Expected post-action, annotate
- Sentence 18: Expected state change, annotate

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 13
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 14
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 16
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 17
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 18
        }
    ] 
}
```

This output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given requirements.
