I'll go through the document step by step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
(Done)

Step 2 & 3: Identify and categorize sentences as specifications.

Section 1:
No specifications identified.

Section 2:
- Sentence 1: Requirement for state transition (valid local position estimate)
- Sentence 2: Constraint (flying vehicles can't switch without valid local position)
- Sentence 3: Expected state change (failsafe if position estimate is lost)
- Sentence 4: Constraint (prevents arming)
- Sentence 5: Constraint (wind and flight time limits)

Section 3:
- Sentence 0: Requirement for state transition (QGroundControl or compatible GCS/MAVLink API required)
- Sentence 1: Expected post-action (fly to closest point on commanded circle trajectory)
- Sentence 11: Constraint (maximum velocity and acceleration limits)
- Sentence 14: Constraint (minimum radius)
- Sentence 15: Constraint (maximum radius)

Section 4:
No specifications identified.

Section 5:
- Sentence 1: Constraint (initial/default rotation speed and direction)
- Sentence 2: Constraint (maximum acceleration and priority)

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 14
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 15
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications based on the given requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes.
