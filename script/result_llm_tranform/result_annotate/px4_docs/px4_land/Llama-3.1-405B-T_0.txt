Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

Explanation:

* Section 0, Sentence 0: "The _Land_ flight mode causes the vehicle to land at the position where the mode was engaged." This sentence conveys an expected state change in response to a specific command (engaging Land mode).
* Section 0, Sentence 1: "The vehicle will disarm shortly after landing (by default)." This sentence conveys an expected post-action after entering a particular state (landing).
* Section 1, Sentence 1: "2.Mode requires at least a valid local position estimate (does not require a global position)." This sentence conveys a requirement for state transition (valid local position estimate).
* Section 1, Sentence 2: "Flying vehicles can't switch to this mode without valid local position." This sentence conveys a constraint for state transition (valid local position required).
* Section 1, Sentence 3: "Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate." This sentence conveys an expected state change in response to a specific condition (loss of position estimate).
* Section 1, Sentence 4: "3.Mode prevents arming (vehicle must be armed when switching to this mode)." This sentence conveys a constraint for state transition (vehicle must be armed).
* Section 1, Sentence 6: "6.The mode can be triggered using the MAV_CMD_NAV_LAND MAVLink command, or by explicitly switching to Land mode." This sentence conveys an expected state change in response to a specific command (MAV_CMD_NAV_LAND or explicit mode switch).
* Section 2, Sentence 0: "The vehicle will land at the location at which the mode was engaged." This sentence conveys an expected state change in response to a specific command (engaging Land mode).
* Section 2, Sentence 1: "The vehicle descends at the rate specified in MPC_LAND_SPEED and will disarm after landing (by default)." This sentence conveys an expected post-action after entering a particular state (landing).
* Section 2, Sentence 2: "RC stick movement will change the vehicle to Position mode (by default)." This sentence conveys an expected state change in response to a specific command (RC stick movement).
