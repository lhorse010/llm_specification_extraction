Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

Explanation:

* Section 0, Sentence 0: "The _Land_ flight mode causes the vehicle to land at the position where the mode was engaged." This sentence conveys an expected state change.
* Section 0, Sentence 1: "The vehicle will disarm shortly after landing (by default)." This sentence conveys an expected post-action.
* Section 1, Sentence 1: "2.Mode requires at least a valid local position estimate (does not require a global position)." This sentence conveys a requirement for state transition.
* Section 1, Sentence 2: "Flying vehicles can't switch to this mode without valid local position." This sentence conveys a constraint.
* Section 1, Sentence 3: "Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate." This sentence conveys an expected state change.
* Section 1, Sentence 4: "3.Mode prevents arming (vehicle must be armed when switching to this mode)." This sentence conveys a constraint.
* Section 1, Sentence 6: "5.RC stick movement in a multicopter (or VTOL in multicopter mode) will by default change the vehicle to Position mode unless handling a critical battery failsafe." This sentence conveys an expected state change.
* Section 2, Sentence 0: "The vehicle will land at the location at which the mode was engaged." This sentence conveys an expected state change.
* Section 2, Sentence 1: "The vehicle descends at the rate specified in MPC_LAND_SPEED and will disarm after landing (by default)." This sentence conveys an expected post-action.
* Section 2, Sentence 2: "RC stick movement will change the vehicle to Position mode (by default)." This sentence conveys an expected state change.

Note that some sentences in the document are not annotated as specifications because they do not convey clear and specific information about state transitions, constraints, post-actions, or state changes.
