```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications according to the given requirements.
