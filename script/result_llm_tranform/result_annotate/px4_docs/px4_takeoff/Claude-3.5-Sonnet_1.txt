I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria for specifications.

Step 1: I have read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now categorize and annotate relevant sentences:

Section 0:
- No sentences meet the criteria for specification.

Section 1:
- Sentence 1: Expected state change (automatic mode)
- Sentence 2: Pre-requirement (valid local position estimate)
- Sentence 3: Constraint (can't switch to this mode without valid local position)
- Sentence 4: Expected state change (failsafe if position estimate is lost)
- Sentence 5: Constraint (can't arm without valid position estimate)
- Sentence 6: Expected state change (RC stick movement changes to Position mode)
- Sentence 7: Expected state change (Failure Detector stops engines if problem on takeoff)

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Expected post-action (ascends to defined altitude and holds position)
- Sentence 1: Expected state change (RC stick movement changes to Position mode)

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications, following the required format.
