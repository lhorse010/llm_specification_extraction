I've carefully analyzed the document and identified the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications. Here's the result in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they describe specific requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or state changes in the Acro Mode system for multicopters. They provide clear and specific information about how the system should behave in response to user inputs or in certain states.
