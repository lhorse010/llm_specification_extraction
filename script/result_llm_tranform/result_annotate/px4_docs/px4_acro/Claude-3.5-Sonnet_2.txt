I've carefully read through the document and analyzed each sentence based on the given criteria. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

Step 1: I've thoroughly read the document.

Step 2 & 3: I've identified sentences that convey information about state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, or expected state changes. These sentences will be annotated as specifications.

Step 4: I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON as per the output format.

Here's the result:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

These sentences were selected because they clearly describe requirements for state transitions, constraints the system must adhere to, expected post-actions, or expected state changes in response to specific commands or settings in the Acro Mode for Multicopters.
