Let's go through this document step-by-step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document about the Position Slow Mode for Multicopters.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 4: Constraint on system behavior
- Sentence 5: Expected state change in response to specific settings
- Sentence 6: Constraint on system behavior

Section 1:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change in response to specific settings
- Sentence 5: Constraint on system behavior

Section 2:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change in response to specific settings
- Sentence 2: Expected state change in response to specific settings
- Sentence 3: Expected state change in response to specific settings
- Sentence 4: Constraint on system behavior

Section 3:
- Sentence 1: Requirement for state transition
- Sentence 2: Requirement for state transition
- Sentence 3: Requirement for state transition
- Sentence 4: Expected state change in response to specific settings

Section 4:
- Sentence 0: Expected state change in response to specific settings
- Sentence 2: Expected state change in response to specific settings
- Sentence 3: Constraint on system behavior
- Sentence 4: Expected state change in response to specific settings

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON output contains all the sentences that meet our criteria for specifications, following the required format.
