I'll go through the document step-by-step to identify and annotate the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read the entire document about the Traffic Light module.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the result of the analysis:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 11
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation of the selected specifications:

1. Section 2, Sentence 0: This describes a requirement for state transition (activation of the module).

2. Section 3, Sentences 0-4: These describe the expected state changes and post-actions the system will execute based on specific conditions.

3. Section 3, Sentences 7-8: These describe expected state changes based on the vehicle's current velocity.

4. Section 3, Sentences 10-11: These describe expected state changes based on specific conditions during the yellow light phase.

The other sentences in the document were not included as specifications because they either provide general information, explanations, or are not specific enough to be considered clear specifications according to the given criteria.
