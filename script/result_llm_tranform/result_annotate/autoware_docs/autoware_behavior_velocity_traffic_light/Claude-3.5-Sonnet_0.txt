I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences that meet the specification criteria as requested. Let's go through this step-by-step.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read and understood the contents of the document about the Traffic Light module.

Step 2 & 3: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information and annotate them as specifications if they do.

After careful analysis, here are the sentences that qualify as specifications:

1. Section 2, Sentence 0: Activation requirement
2. Section 3, Sentences 1-4: State transition requirements and expected actions
3. Section 3, Sentences 7-8: State transition requirements based on velocity
4. Section 3, Sentences 10-11: Expected state changes in response to specific conditions
5. Section 4, Sentences 4-5: Constraints and expected actions in the dilemma zone
6. Section 4, Sentences 8-9: Constraints and expected actions in the optional zone

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the output in the required format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 1
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 3,
            "sentence-id": 11
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 4,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications, including requirements for state transition, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. The sentences are clear and specific, adhering to the given requirement.
