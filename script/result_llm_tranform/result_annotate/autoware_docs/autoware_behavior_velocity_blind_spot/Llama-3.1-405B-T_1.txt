Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:

1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

* Section 1, Sentence 0: This sentence specifies the activation timing of the blind spot module, which is a constraint the system must adhere to.
* Section 2, Sentence 0: This sentence specifies the setup of the stop line, pass judge line, detection area, and conflict area, which are requirements the system must meet for state transition.
* Section 2, Sentence 5: This sentence specifies the conditions for transitioning to the "stop" state, which is an expected state change.
* Section 2, Sentence 6 and 7: These sentences specify the conditions for stopping, which are requirements the system must meet for state transition.
* Section 2, Sentence 8: This sentence specifies a constraint to avoid rapid stops.
* Section 2, Sentence 9: This sentence specifies a constraint to prevent chattering of the state.

Note that Sentences 1-4 in Section 2 are not annotated as specifications because they provide additional information about the setup of the stop line, pass judge line, detection area, and conflict area, but do not convey any of the four types of information mentioned above.
