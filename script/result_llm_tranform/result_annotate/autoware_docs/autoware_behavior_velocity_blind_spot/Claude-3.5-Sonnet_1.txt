I'll analyze the document and annotate the sentences that meet the specified criteria. Let's go through this step by step:

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read and understood the document about the Blind Spot module.

Step 2: Determine whether sentences convey relevant information.
Step 3: Annotate relevant sentences as specifications.

Going through each section:

Section 0 (Role):
- Sentence 0: This is a general description, not a specification.

Section 1 (Activation Timing):
- Sentence 0: This is a specification for state transition requirement.

Section 2 (Inner-workings / Algorithms):
- Sentence 0: This is a specification for expected post-action.
- Sentences 1-4: These are descriptions, not specifications.
- Sentence 5: This is a specification for state change.
- Sentences 6-7: These are part of the conditions mentioned in sentence 5, so they're included in that specification.
- Sentence 8: This is a specification for a constraint.
- Sentence 9: This is a specification for state change and constraint.

Step 4: Format the annotated sentences in JSON.

Here's the output in the required format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes all the sentences that meet the criteria for specifications as per the given instructions.
