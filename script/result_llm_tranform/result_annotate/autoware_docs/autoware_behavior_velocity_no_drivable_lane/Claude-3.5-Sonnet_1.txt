I'll analyze the document and annotate sentences that meet the specified criteria. Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: I've read the document thoroughly.

Step 2 & 3: I'll now determine which sentences convey relevant information and should be annotated as specifications.

Section 0:
- Sentence 8: Expected state change (how a lanelet becomes invalid)
- Sentence 9: Constraint and expected post-action (stop before entering no drivable lane or keep stationary)
- Sentence 10: Expected post-action (request human driver intervention)

Section 1:
- Sentence 0: State transition pre-requirement (activation condition)

Section 2:
- Sentences 2-8: Expected state changes and constraints (state machine transitions and conditions)

Step 4: Now, I'll format the annotated sentences in JSON as per the specified output format.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 8
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 9
        },
        {
            "section-id": 0,
            "sentence-id": 10
        },
        {
            "section-id": 1,
            "sentence-id": 0
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 2
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 3
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 4
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 5
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 6
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 7
        },
        {
            "section-id": 2,
            "sentence-id": 8
        }
    ]
}
```

This output includes all sentences that meet the criteria for specifications, including state transition pre-requirements, constraints, expected post-actions, and expected state changes. The sentences are clear and specific, adhering to the given requirement.
