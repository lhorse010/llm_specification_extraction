Based on the provided document, I will annotate the sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:
1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Here are the annotated sentences in JSON format:

Explanation:

- Section 0, Sentence 1: This sentence defines what a "no drivable lane" is, which is a constraint the system must adhere to.
- Section 0, Sentence 8: This sentence specifies how a lanelet becomes invalid, which is a requirement for state transition.
- Section 0, Sentence 9: This sentence describes the expected post-action of the system when entering a "no drivable lane" state.
- Section 0, Sentence 10: This sentence describes another expected post-action of the system when entering a "no drivable lane" state.
- Section 1, Sentence 0: This sentence specifies the activation timing of the function, which is a constraint the system must adhere to.
- Section 2, Sentences 3-8: These sentences describe the expected state changes of the system in response to specific conditions, which are requirements for state transition.
