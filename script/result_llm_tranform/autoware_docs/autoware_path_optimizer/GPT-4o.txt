  {
    "sentence": "When one of the following conditions are met, trajectory optimization will be executed.",
    "formula": "(C1 ∨ C2 ∨ C3 ∨ C4) → O",
    "explanation": "Here, C1, C2, C3, and C4 represent the four specific conditions listed, and O represents the execution of trajectory optimization. The formula states that if any of these conditions are true, then optimization is triggered."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "1.Ego moves longer than replan.max_ego_moving_dist in one cycle. (default: 3.0 [m])",
    "formula": "F(E)",
    "explanation": "E represents the event where the ego moves more than the specified distance. The formula uses F to indicate that this event eventually occurs within the specified conditions."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "2.Trajectory's end, which is considered as the goal pose, moves longer than replan.max_goal_moving_dist in one cycle. (default: 15.0 [ms])",
    "formula": "F(G)",
    "explanation": "G represents the goal pose moving beyond the specified limit. F(G) indicates that this condition will eventually be met."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "3.Time passes. (default: 1.0 [s])",
    "formula": "F(T)",
    "explanation": "T represents the passage of time beyond the specified threshold. F(T) ensures that this condition will eventually be satisfied."

  {
    "sentence": "4.The input path changes laterally longer than replan.max_path_shape_around_ego_lat_dist in one cycle. (default: 2.0)",
    "formula": "F(P)",
    "explanation": "P denotes the lateral change in the input path exceeding the set limit. F(P) signifies that this condition will eventually occur."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "This module makes the trajectory kinematically-feasible and collision-free.",
    "formula": "G(K ∧ ¬C)",
    "explanation": "K represents kinematic feasibility and ¬C represents being collision-free. G(K ∧ ¬C) ensures that both conditions are always maintained."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "This optimization considers vehicle kinematics and collision checking with road boundary and obstacles.",
    "formula": "G(O → (K ∧ C))",
    "explanation": "O indicates the optimization process. K and C ensure that both vehicle kinematics and collision checks are considered throughout the optimization."

  {
    "sentence": "1.If optimized trajectory is inside the drivable area, and the remained trajectory is inside/outside the drivable area, the output trajectory will be just concatenation of those two trajectories.",
    "formula": "((I ∧ (R ∨ ¬R)) → C)",
    "explanation": "I represents the optimized trajectory inside the area, R the remaining trajectory condition. The formula states that if these conditions hold, the output will be a concatenation (C)."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "2.If optimized trajectory is outside the drivable area, and the remained trajectory is inside/outside the drivable area, and if the previously generated trajectory is memorized, the output trajectory will be the previously generated trajectory, where zero velocity is inserted to the point firstly going outside the drivable area; and if the previously generated trajectory is not memorized, the output trajectory will be a part of trajectory just transformed from the behavior path, where zero velocity is inserted to the point firstly going outside the drivable area.",
    "formula": "((¬I ∧ (R ∨ ¬R) ∧ M) → P) ∧ ((¬I ∧ (R ∨ ¬R) ∧ ¬M) → B)",
    "explanation": "¬I indicates the optimized trajectory is outside. M represents memorization of the trajectory. P is the previously generated trajectory, and B is the transformed behavior path. The formula captures both possible outcomes based on memorization."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Therefore, we have to make sure that the optimized trajectory is inside the drivable area or not after optimization.",
    "formula": "F(I ∨ ¬I)",
    "explanation": "I represents the optimized trajectory being inside. F(I ∨ ¬I) ensures that after optimization, the trajectory is verified to be either inside or outside, capturing the need for checking."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "option.enable_outside_drivable_area_stop enables stopping just before the generated trajectory point will be outside the drivable area.",
    "formula": "G((¬O ∧ X¬O) → S)",
    "explanation": "Here, O represents the generated trajectory being outside the drivable area. The formula expresses that globally, if the next point is outside (X¬O), then the system must stop (S) just before this point."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "2.insert stop point before the planned footprint will be outside the drivable area",
    "formula": "G((¬O ∧ X¬O) → S)",
    "explanation": "Similar to the first sentence, this formula ensures that globally, if the next planned footprint will be outside the drivable area (X¬O), then a stop point (S) is inserted before reaching this condition."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Otherwise, previously optimized trajectory is used with updating the velocity from the latest input path.",
    "formula": "G(¬C → (U ∧ V))",
    "explanation": "C represents a condition where the current trajectory is invalid. The formula states that globally, if this condition is not met (¬C), then use the previously optimized trajectory (U) and update the velocity (V) from the latest input."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The trajectory just in front of the ego must not be changed a lot so that the steering wheel will be stable.",
    "formula": "G(T → (C ∧ S))",
    "explanation": "Here, T represents the trajectory in front of the ego. The formula dictates that globally, if T is present, it must not change significantly (C) to ensure stability in the steering (S)."

  {
    "sentence": "Generated trajectory is checked if it is inside the drivable area or not, and if outside drivable area, output a trajectory inside drivable area with the behavior path or the previously generated trajectory.",
    "formula": "G((¬I → (B ∨ P)))",
    "explanation": "I represents being inside the drivable area. The formula ensures that globally, if a trajectory is not inside (¬I), then output a trajectory inside using either the behavior path (B) or the previously generated trajectory (P)."
