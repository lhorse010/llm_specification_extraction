    "sentence": "2.Mode requires at least a valid local position estimate (does not require a global position).",
    "formula": "G(V → L)",
    "explanation": "Here, V represents the mode being active, and L represents a valid local position estimate. The formula states that globally, if the mode is active, then a valid local position estimate must exist."

    "sentence": "Flying vehicles can't switch to this mode without valid local position.",
    "formula": "G(¬L → ¬XV)",

    "sentence": "Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate.",
    "formula": "G(L ∧ ¬XL → XF)",
    "explanation": "Here, L represents a valid position estimate, and F represents the failsafe mode. The formula states that globally, if a valid position estimate exists but will not exist at the next time step, then the vehicle will enter failsafe mode at some future time step."

    "explanation": "Here, A represents the vehicle being armed, L represents a valid position estimate, and V represents the mode being active. The formula states that globally, if the vehicle is disarmed, then even if a valid position estimate does not exist, the vehicle can switch to this mode, but it cannot arm at the next time step."

    "sentence": "4.RC stick movement will by default change the vehicle to Position mode unless handling a critical battery failsafe.",
    "formula": "G(R ∧ ¬F → XV)",
    "explanation": "Here, R represents RC stick movement, F represents a critical battery failsafe, and V represents the Position mode. The formula states that globally, if RC stick movement occurs and the vehicle is not handling a critical battery failsafe, then the vehicle will switch to Position mode at the next time step."

    "sentence": "5.The Failure Detector will automatically stop the engines if there is a problem on takeoff.",
    "formula": "G(P → XF)",

    "sentence": "A multi rotor ascends vertically to the altitude defined in MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT and holds position.",

    "explanation": "Here, A represents the multi rotor ascending, H represents reaching the altitude defined in MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT, and P represents holding position. The formula states that globally, if the multi rotor ascends, then it will reach the specified altitude and hold position at some future time step."
