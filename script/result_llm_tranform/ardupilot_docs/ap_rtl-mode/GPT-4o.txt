    "explanation": "R represents RTL being commanded. The formula states that this will eventually result in the copter returning to the home position (H), where it was originally armed."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "In RTL mode the autopilot uses a barometer which measures air pressure as the primary means for determining altitude (\"Pressure Altitude\") and if the air pressure is changing in your flight area, the copter will follow the air pressure change rather than actual altitude (unless you are within 20 feet of the ground and have SONAR installed and enabled).",
    "formula": "P → (B ∧ (¬S ∨ A))",
    "explanation": "P indicates RTL mode. B represents using a barometer for altitude. The formula states that the copter follows air pressure changes unless within 20 feet and SONAR is installed (S), in which case actual altitude (A) is followed."

    "sentence": "1.RTL_ALT: The minimum altitude the copter will move to before returning to launch.",
    "formula": "F(A ∧ B)",
    "explanation": "A represents the copter reaching the minimum altitude, and B represents the initiation of the return to launch sequence. The formula captures that eventually the copter will reach this altitude before returning."

    "formula": "F(C ∨ D)",
    "explanation": "C represents reaching the final RTL altitude, and D represents reaching this altitude after completing a mission. The formula ensures that at least one of these conditions eventually holds."

    "formula": "F(J ∧ K)",
    "explanation": "J represents the vehicle initiating a climb, and K ensures that it reaches the minimum climb requirement. The formula captures this requirement being fulfilled initially."

    "formula": "G(M → N)",
    "explanation": "M represents the condition of RTL-ing from close to home, and N represents the climb limitation by the cone slope. The formula ensures this relationship is always maintained."

    "formula": "F(O ∧ P → Q)",
    "explanation": "O represents achieving GPS lock, P represents the LEDs being solid, and Q represents arming and takeoff. The formula captures that GPS lock is a prerequisite for arming and takeoff."
