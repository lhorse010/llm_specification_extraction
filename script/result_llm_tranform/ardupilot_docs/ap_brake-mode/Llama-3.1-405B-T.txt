  {
    "sentence": "This mode requires GPS.",
    "formula": "G(GPS)",
    "explanation": "Here, GPS represents the requirement for GPS. The globally operator G ensures that this requirement holds at all times."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Brake mode is subject to acceleration and angle limits imposed by the position and attitude controllers.",
    "formula": "G(B → (A ∧ L))",
    "explanation": "Here, B represents Brake mode, A represents acceleration limits, and L represents angle limits. The globally operator G ensures that whenever Brake mode is active, the acceleration and angle limits are imposed."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Once invoked, this mode does not accept any input from the pilot.",
    "formula": "G(I → ¬P)",
    "explanation": "Here, I represents the invocation of the mode, and P represents the acceptance of pilot input. The globally operator G ensures that once the mode is invoked, pilot input is not accepted at any point in the future."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "When switched on, Brake mode will attempt to stop the vehicle as quickly as possible.",
    "formula": "G(O → F(S))",
    "explanation": "Here, O represents the switching on of Brake mode, and S represents the stopping of the vehicle. The globally operator G ensures that whenever Brake mode is switched on, the vehicle will eventually stop."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "If the vehicle is landed in Brake mode it will immediately disarm.",
    "formula": "G((B ∧ L) → X(D))",
    "explanation": "Here, B represents Brake mode, L represents the vehicle being landed, and D represents the disarming of the vehicle. The globally operator G ensures that whenever the vehicle is landed in Brake mode, it will disarm at the next time step."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The pilots controls are ignored in this mode.",
    "formula": "G(M → ¬P)",
    "explanation": "Here, M represents the mode, and P represents the acceptance of pilot control. The globally operator G ensures that whenever the mode is active, pilot control is ignored."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The vehicle must be switched out of this mode before the pilot can re-take control.",
    "formula": "G((M ∧ P) → F(¬M))",
    "explanation": "Here, M represents the mode, and P represents the acceptance of pilot control. The globally operator G ensures that whenever the mode is active and pilot control is accepted, the mode will eventually be switched off."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "This very simple flight mode simply stops the vehicle as soon as possible.",
    "formula": "G(M → F(S))",
    "explanation": "Here, M represents the flight mode, and S represents the stopping of the vehicle. The globally operator G ensures that whenever the flight mode is active, the vehicle will eventually stop."
