    "sentence": "Pure rate mode stabilization, utilizing only the gyros with no attitude feedback from the accelerometers, can be forced by setting bit 1 of ACRO_OPTIONS to one.",
    "formula": "F(A ∧ ¬B)",
    "explanation": "A represents setting bit 1 of ACRO_OPTIONS to one, which forces pure rate mode stabilization. B represents using accelerometer feedback, which is negated here."

  {
    "sentence": "If the pilot puts the throttle completely down the motors will go to their minimum rate and stabilization will cease.",
    "formula": "G(T → (M ∧ ¬S))",
    "explanation": "T represents the throttle being completely down. M represents motors at minimum rate, and ¬S represents stabilization ceasing."

    "sentence": "The vehicle will automatically return to the level when the pilot releases the sticks.",

  {
    "sentence": "Includes the automatic leveling as option #1 but in addition the vehicle will not lean more than 45 degrees (this angle can be configured with the ANGLE_MAX parameter).",
    "formula": "G(O₁ ∧ ¬A₄₅)",
    "explanation": "O₁ represents automatic leveling, and ¬A₄₅ represents the vehicle not leaning more than 45 degrees, defined by the ANGLE_MAX parameter."

  {
    "sentence": "By setting the ACRO_BAL_ROLL and ACRO_BAL_PITCH parameters to non-zero values, this feature takes effect.",
    "formula": "F(B_R ∧ B_P → F)",
    "explanation": "B_R and B_P represent non-zero values for ACRO_BAL_ROLL and ACRO_BAL_PITCH, respectively. F indicates the feature taking effect."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Let's say you have a highly nimble quadcopter and you have your ACRO_RP_RATE parameter set to 9, which translates to a roll request of ~400deg/sec.",
    "formula": "G(N ∧ R₉)",
    "explanation": "N represents having a nimble quadcopter, and R₉ represents setting ACRO_RP_RATE to 9, leading to a roll rate of ~400deg/sec."

  {
    "sentence": "Acro mode can be setup to provide full stabilization at idle throttle.",
    "formula": "G(I → S)",
    "explanation": "I represents idle throttle, and S denotes full stabilization being provided."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "With a 3 position switch the off position (i.e. PWM < 1200) will disable the trainer, middle position will enable option #1 (automatic leveling) and the top position (i.e. PWM > 1800) will enable option #2 (leveling and lean angle limited).",
    "formula": "G((P₀ → ¬T) ∧ (P₁ → O₁) ∧ (P₂ → O₂))",
    "explanation": "P₀, P₁, and P₂ represent the PWM positions for off, middle, and top, respectively. ¬T disables the trainer, O₁ enables option #1, and O₂ enables option #2."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The Virtual Flybar will add decay term to the attitude controller to bleed off accumulated differences between the current attitude and accumulated commanded attitude, if the copter has not quickly obtained it, such as when sitting on the ground but stick inputs are being given.",
    "formula": "G((¬Q ∧ G) → D)",
    "explanation": "Q represents the copter quickly obtaining the commanded attitude, G indicates sitting on the ground with stick inputs, and D represents the Virtual Flybar adding a decay term."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The default, 4.5, will command a 200deg/sec rotation rate.",
    "formula": "G(DEFAULT → ROTATION_RATE_200)",
    "explanation": "The predicate DEFAULT indicates the default setting of 4.5, and ROTATION_RATE_200 represents achieving a 200deg/sec rotation. The formula asserts that whenever the default is set, this rotation rate is commanded globally."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "This value can be increased to improve attitude control when the throttle is cut for better Airmode handling, however a stable tune is essential before it can be increased.",
    "formula": "G((THROTTLE_CUT ∧ STABLE_TUNE) → F(INCREASE_VALUE ∧ IMPROVED_CONTROL))",
    "explanation": "This formula states that globally, if the throttle is cut and a stable tune is achieved, eventually the value can be increased leading to improved attitude control."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Raising the INS_GYRO_FILTER cutoff frequency and retuning may allow better responsiveness, but appropriate harmonic notch filtering to prevent noise impacts must be setup prior to retuning.",
    "formula": "G((NOTCH_FILTER_SETUP ∧ RETUNING) → F(BETTER_RESPONSIVENESS))",
    "explanation": "This formula indicates that globally, setting up the notch filter and retuning will eventually allow for better responsiveness. The setup is a prerequisite to retuning."

  {
    "sentence": "The default, 4.5, like roll and pitch, will command a 200deg/sec rotation rate.",
    "formula": "G((DEFAULT ∧ (ROLL ∨ PITCH)) → ROTATION_RATE_200)",
    "explanation": "This states that globally, when the default is set to 4.5 and either roll or pitch is involved, a 200deg/sec rotation rate is commanded."
