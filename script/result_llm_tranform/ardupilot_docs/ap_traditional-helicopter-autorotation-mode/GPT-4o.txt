  {
    "sentence": "The motor ramp time defined by H_RSC_RAMP_TIME is ignored during bail-out, and a hard-coded ramp time of one second is used.",
    "formula": "G(BailOut → (¬Use(H_RSC_RAMP_TIME) ∧ Use(HardCodedRampTime)))",
    "explanation": "During bail-out, the defined ramp time is ignored, and a fixed one-second ramp time is applied instead."

    "explanation": "T represents the aircraft touching down, I represents the interlock being re-engaged, and B represents the initiation of the bail-out phase. The formula captures that if the aircraft touches down (T), then immediately (X) the interlock is re-engaged (I), which allows for the bail-out phase (B) to be initiated within one second."
