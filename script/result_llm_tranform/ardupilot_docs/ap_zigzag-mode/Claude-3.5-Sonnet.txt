  {
    "sentence": "1.A two or preferably three position auxiliary switch is set to \"ZigZag SaveWP\" (i.e. RC7_OPTION = 61)",
    "formula": "G(S → (T ∨ P))",
    "explanation": "S represents the switch being set, T represents a two-position switch, and P represents a three-position switch. The formula states that globally, when the switch is set, it's either in a two-position or (preferably) three-position configuration."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "2.The pilot arms the vehicle in Loiter mode, takes off and then changes to ZigZag mode (in the future we may make it possible to arm and take-off in ZigZag mode)",
    "formula": "F(A ∧ X(T ∧ X(Z)))",
    "explanation": "A represents arming in Loiter mode, T represents taking off, and Z represents changing to ZigZag mode. The formula captures the sequence of events: eventually, the vehicle is armed, then in the next state it takes off, and in the following state, it changes to ZigZag mode."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "3.The vehicle is flown manually (it flies like Loiter) to one side of the field and then the auxiliary switch is moved to the highest or lowest position (it doesn't matter which) to record that side",
    "formula": "F(M U (S ∧ (H ∨ L)))",
    "explanation": "M represents manual flight, S represents reaching a side of the field, H represents the switch in the highest position, and L represents the switch in the lowest position. The formula states that eventually, manual flight occurs until reaching a side and moving the switch to either the highest or lowest position."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "5.The switch can now be used to start the vehicle flying autonomously (at the current height) to either side of the field.",
    "formula": "G(W → F(A))",
    "explanation": "W represents the switch being used, and A represents autonomous flight. The formula states that globally, when the switch is used, it eventually leads to autonomous flight."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Once the vehicle reaches the other side it will revert to manual control.",
    "formula": "G(R → X(M))",
    "explanation": "R represents reaching the other side, and M represents manual control. The formula states that globally, when the vehicle reaches the other side, in the next state it reverts to manual control."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The pilot can also regain manual control by moving the auxiliary switch to the middle position or by changing the flight mode.",
    "formula": "G((S ∨ C) → X(M))",
    "explanation": "S represents moving the switch to the middle position, C represents changing the flight mode, and M represents manual control. The formula states that globally, when either the switch is moved to the middle or the flight mode is changed, manual control is regained in the next state."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "6.If a downward facing range finder is used, the vehicle will follow the terrain when flying.",
    "formula": "G(R → (F → T))",
    "explanation": "R represents the range finder being used, F represents flying, and T represents following the terrain. The formula states that globally, when the range finder is used, flying implies terrain following."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "If the range finder becomes unhealthy while traversing from one side to the other, the vehicle will revert to manual control and come to a stop.",
    "formula": "G((T ∧ U) → X(M ∧ S))",
    "explanation": "T represents traversing, U represents an unhealthy range finder, M represents manual control, and S represents stopping. The formula states that globally, if the range finder becomes unhealthy during traversal, in the next state the vehicle reverts to manual control and stops."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "When flown manually ZigZag uses Loiter mode's parameters.",
    "formula": "G((M ∧ Z) → L)",
    "explanation": "M represents manual flight, Z represents ZigZag mode, and L represents using Loiter mode parameters. The formula states that globally, when in manual flight and ZigZag mode, Loiter mode parameters are used."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "When autonomously flying from one side of the field to the other, the Auto mode parameters are used.",
    "formula": "G((A ∧ F) → U)",
    "explanation": "A represents autonomous flight, F represents flying from one side to the other, and U represents using Auto mode parameters. The formula states that globally, during autonomous flight between sides, Auto mode parameters are used."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Upon activation, the vehicle will move in ZIGZ_DIRECTION with respect to its heading for ZIGZ_SIDE_DIST, then proceed to cross the field until the opposite ZigZagWP is reached.",
    "formula": "G(A → (M ∧ X(C U R)))",
    "explanation": "A represents activation, M is moving in ZIGZ_DIRECTION for ZIGZ_SIDE_DIST, C is crossing the field, and R is reaching the opposite ZigZagWP. The formula ensures that whenever activation occurs, the vehicle moves as specified, then crosses the field until reaching the waypoint."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "It will then wait for ZIGZ_WP_DELAY to allow sprayer to fully stop and then move ZIGZ_SIDE_DIST down the side of the field again to proceed back across the area.",
    "formula": "G(R → (W ∧ X(S ∧ X(M ∧ X(C)))))",
    "explanation": "R is reaching the waypoint, W is waiting for ZIGZ_WP_DELAY, S is the sprayer fully stopping, M is moving ZIGZ_SIDE_DIST, and C is crossing back. This formula captures the sequence of events after reaching the waypoint, including the delay and subsequent movement."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "It will do this for ZIGZ_LINE_NUM times (-1 = infinite until switched out of this mode, =0 will only move to the first field crossing position, but not proceed further).",
    "formula": "G((N ∧ ¬Z) → ((M ∧ X(C)) U Z)) ∨ (N ∧ Z → M)",
    "explanation": "N represents ZIGZ_LINE_NUM > 0, Z is switching out of this mode, M is moving to the field crossing position, and C is completing a crossing. This formula handles both the repeating case (when N is true and not switched out) and the case where only one movement occurs (when N is false)."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Moving the ZigZag Auto switch to the low position immediately stops this mode and returns to normal ZIGZAG mode.",
    "formula": "G(L → (S ∧ X(Z)))",
    "explanation": "L represents moving the switch to low position, S is stopping the current mode, and Z is entering normal ZIGZAG mode. This formula ensures that whenever the switch is moved to low, the current mode stops and normal mode is immediately entered."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "This function must be enabled with ZIGZ_AUTO_ENABLE = 1, and parameters reloaded, before any parameters are visible and the feature enabled.",
    "formula": "G(F → (E ∧ R ∧ X(V ∧ F)))",
    "explanation": "F represents the function being active, E is ZIGZ_AUTO_ENABLE set to 1, R is reloading parameters, V is parameters becoming visible, and F (second occurrence) is the feature being enabled. This formula ensures the correct sequence of events for enabling the function."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The vehicle is flown to the other side of the field and the switch is moved to the opposite position",
    "formula": "G(F → (X(S)))",
    "explanation": "F represents flying to the other side of the field, and S is moving the switch to the opposite position. This formula captures the sequence of flying followed by switch movement, which is assumed to happen in the next immediate state."
