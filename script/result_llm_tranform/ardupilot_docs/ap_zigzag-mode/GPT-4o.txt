  {
    "sentence": "1.A two or preferably three position auxiliary switch is set to \"ZigZag SaveWP\" (i.e. RC7_OPTION = 61)",
    "formula": "F(S ∧ (RC7_OPTION = 61))",
    "explanation": "The formula indicates that at some point in the future (F), the switch S will be set to 'ZigZag SaveWP', represented by RC7_OPTION being set to 61."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "2.The pilot arms the vehicle in Loiter mode, takes off and then changes to ZigZag mode (in the future we may make it possible to arm and take-off in ZigZag mode)",
    "formula": "F(A ∧ L ∧ F(T ∧ Z))",
    "explanation": "The vehicle is armed (A) and takes off in Loiter mode (L), and eventually (F) switches to ZigZag mode (Z). The sequence is maintained over time."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "5.The switch can now be used to start the vehicle flying autonomously (at the current height) to either side of the field.",
    "formula": "F(S ∧ A)",
    "explanation": "Eventually (F), the switch (S) is used to start autonomous flight (A) at the current height, covering either side of the field."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "6.If a downward facing range finder is used, the vehicle will follow the terrain when flying.",
    "formula": "G(R → T)",
    "explanation": "Globally (G), if the range finder (R) is used, the vehicle will follow the terrain (T) during flight."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "If the range finder becomes unhealthy while traversing from one side to the other, the vehicle will revert to manual control and come to a stop.",
    "formula": "G(U → (M ∧ S))",
    "explanation": "Globally (G), if the range finder becomes unhealthy (U), the vehicle will revert to manual control (M) and stop (S)."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "After the field's side points are registered, if you have an RC switch configured with RCx_OPTION = 83 (ZigZag Auto Mode), you can automatically cover the field side to side at a programmable distance interval, also enabling a sprayer, if equipped.",
    "formula": "R ∧ (RCx_OPTION = 83) → F(C ∧ P)",
    "explanation": "Once the field's points are registered (R) and the RC switch is set (RCx_OPTION = 83), the field can be automatically covered (C) and a sprayer can be enabled (P)."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "3.Upon activation, the vehicle will move in ZIGZ_DIRECTION with respect to its heading for ZIGZ_SIDE_DIST, then proceed to cross the field until the opposite ZigZagWP is reached.",
    "formula": "A → F(Z ∧ (C U W))",
    "explanation": "Upon activation (A), the vehicle moves in the ZigZag direction (Z) for a set distance and continues (U) until the waypoint (W) is reached."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "It will do this for ZIGZ_LINE_NUM times (-1 = infinite until switched out of this mode, =0 will only move to the first field crossing position, but not proceed further).",
    "formula": "G(L → F(C ∨ ¬P))",
    "explanation": "Globally (G), for a given number of lines (L), the vehicle will continue crossing (C) or stop (¬P) based on the specified line number."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Moving the ZigZag Auto switch to the low position immediately stops this mode and returns to normal ZIGZAG mode.",
    "formula": "G(L → (S ∧ N))",
    "explanation": "Globally (G), if the switch is moved to a low position (L), the mode stops (S) and returns to normal ZigZag mode (N)."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "this function must be enabled with ZIGZ_AUTO_ENABLE = 1, and parameters reloaded, before any parameters are visible and the feature enabled.",
    "formula": "G((ZIGZ_AUTO_ENABLE = 1) → (R ∧ V))",
    "explanation": "Globally (G), if ZIGZ_AUTO_ENABLE is set to 1, parameters are reloaded (R) and become visible (V), enabling the feature."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The vehicle is flown manually (it flies like Loiter) to one side of the field and then the auxiliary switch is moved to the highest or lowest position (it doesn't matter which) to record that side.",
    "formula": "F(FlySide ∧ F(SwitchHigh ∨ SwitchLow))",
    "explanation": "FlySide represents the vehicle reaching one side of the field while flying in Loiter mode. F(SwitchHigh ∨ SwitchLow) indicates that eventually, the switch is moved to either the highest or lowest position to record that side."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The vehicle is flown to the other side of the field and the switch is moved to the opposite position.",
    "formula": "F(FlyOtherSide ∧ F(SwitchOpposite))",
    "explanation": "FlyOtherSide represents the vehicle reaching the opposite side of the field. F(SwitchOpposite) indicates that after reaching, the switch is moved to the position opposite to the previous one."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The vehicle will proceed as shown in the diagram, automatically enabling a sprayer, if setup.",
    "formula": "G(Proceed → EnableSprayer)",
    "explanation": "Proceed represents following the path in the diagram. EnableSprayer ensures that whenever the vehicle proceeds, the sprayer is automatically enabled, assuming it is set up."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "It will then wait for ZIGZ_WP_DELAY to allow sprayer to fully stop and then move ZIGZ_SIDE_DIST down the side of the field again to proceed back across the area.",
    "formula": "F(WaitDelay ∧ F(MoveSideDist ∧ ProceedBack))",
    "explanation": "WaitDelay represents waiting for the ZIGZ_WP_DELAY. F(MoveSideDist ∧ ProceedBack) indicates that after the delay, the vehicle moves the distance ZIGZ_SIDE_DIST and proceeds back across the field."
