Role: You are an expert in the field of software engineering and are very skilled at text annotation.

OBJECTIVE:
From the #@#@#@#@#@DOCUMENT#@#@#@#@#@, annotate sentences as specifications if they convey the following information:
1. Requirements the system must meet for state transition.
2. Constraints the system must adhere to.
3. Expected post-actions the system will execute when entering a particular state.
4. Expected state changes the system will carry out in response to specific commands or settings.

Let's go through this step by step to ensure we arrive at the correct answer.
STEPS:
Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
Step 2: In context, determine whether a sentence conveys information in the following categories: "state transition pre-requirement", "constraint", "expected post-action", "expected state change", or determine whether it conveys no information in any of these categories.
Step 3: If a sentence is categorized as a pre-requirement, constraint, expected post-action, or expected state change, annotate it as a specification.
Step 4: Format all the annotated sentences in JSON.

INPUT FORMAT:
{
    "title": "",
    "sections": [
        {
            "section-title": "",
            "section-id": "0",
            "sentences": [
                {
                    "sentence-id": "0",
                    "text":  "XXXXX"
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}

The output must strictly follow the OUTPUT FORMAT.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "section-id": ...,
            "sentence-id": ...
        },...
    ] 
}
```

REQUIREMENT:
1. Specification sentences should be clear and specific; vague sentences should be excluded.
