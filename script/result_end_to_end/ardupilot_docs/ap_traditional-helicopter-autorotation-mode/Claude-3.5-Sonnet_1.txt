I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the converted sentences in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(¬power → F(autorotation_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if there's a loss of power, the helicopter should eventually enter autorotation mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(autorotation_mode → F(entry_phase ∧ X(glide_phase ∧ X(flare_phase ∧ X(touch_down_phase)))))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in autorotation mode, the helicopter should follow the sequence of entry phase, then glide phase, then flare phase, and finally touch-down phase."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(entry_phase → (minimize_head_speed_loss ∧ manage_attitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, during the entry phase, the helicopter should minimize head speed loss and manage attitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(glide_phase → (manage_head_speed ∧ manage_airspeed))",
            "explanation": "Globally, during the glide phase, the helicopter should manage head speed and airspeed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flare_phase → (reduce_descent_speed ∧ convert_airspeed_to_lift))",
            "explanation": "Globally, during the flare phase, the helicopter should reduce descent speed and convert airspeed into lift."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(touch_down_phase → (use_remaining_energy ∧ maintain_landing_attitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, during the touch-down phase, the helicopter should use remaining energy and maintain a landing attitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(autorotation_mode ∧ power_restored → F(bail_out_phase))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if in autorotation mode and power is restored, the helicopter should eventually enter the bail-out phase."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(¬manual_collective_mode ∧ interlock_disengaged → autorotation_mode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if not in manual collective mode and the interlock is disengaged, the helicopter should enter autorotation mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(bail_out_phase → F(¬autorotation_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, after the bail-out phase, the helicopter should eventually exit autorotation mode."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications for the autonomous autorotation system as described in the document. They cover the mode entry conditions, the sequence of phases during autorotation, the main objectives of each phase, and the conditions for exiting the autorotation mode.
