I'll analyze the document and extract the specifications, then express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here's the result in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active → F(distance_to_lead ≤ FOLL_DIST_MAX))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active, it should eventually be the case that the distance to the lead vehicle is less than or equal to FOLL_DIST_MAX."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active → X(maintain_altitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active, in the next state, the vehicle should maintain its current altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active ∧ (|throttle - mid_throttle| ≤ 10%) → X(maintain_altitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active and the throttle is within 10% of mid-throttle, in the next state, the vehicle should maintain its current altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active ∧ climb_command → X(climb_speed ≤ PILOT_SPEED_UP))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active and a climb command is given, in the next state, the climb speed should be less than or equal to PILOT_SPEED_UP."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active ∧ descend_command → X(descend_speed ≤ PILOT_SPEED_DN))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active and a descend command is given, in the next state, the descend speed should be less than or equal to PILOT_SPEED_DN."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active → F(|current_position - lead_position - offset| ≤ ε))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active, it should eventually be the case that the vehicle's position relative to the lead vehicle's position and the specified offset is within a small error margin ε."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active ∧ FOLL_YAW_BEHAVE = 0 → X(vehicle_heading = lead_vehicle_heading))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active and FOLL_YAW_BEHAVE is set to 0, in the next state, the vehicle's heading should match the lead vehicle's heading."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active ∧ FOLL_YAW_BEHAVE = 1 → X(vehicle_heading = angle_to_lead_vehicle))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active and FOLL_YAW_BEHAVE is set to 1, in the next state, the vehicle's heading should point towards the lead vehicle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active ∧ FOLL_ALT_TYPE = 0 → X(altitude_reference = lead_vehicle_relative_to_home))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active and FOLL_ALT_TYPE is set to 0, in the next state, the altitude reference should be the lead vehicle's altitude relative to home."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_mode_active ∧ FOLL_ALT_TYPE = 1 → X(altitude_reference = lead_vehicle_relative_to_sea_level))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when follow mode is active and FOLL_ALT_TYPE is set to 1, in the next state, the altitude reference should be the lead vehicle's altitude relative to sea level."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the given document. They express the behavior of the vehicle in Follow Mode, including distance maintenance, altitude control, speed limits, positioning relative to the lead vehicle, heading behavior, and altitude reference selection.
