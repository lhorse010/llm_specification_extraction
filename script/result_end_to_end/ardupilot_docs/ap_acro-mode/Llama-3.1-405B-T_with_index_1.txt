    "formula": "G(throttle_manual → no_compensation_for_tilt_angle)",
    "explanation": "The throttle is completely manual with no compensation for tilt angle of the vehicle."
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G(stick_inputs_interpreted_in_body_frame → vehicle_rotates_about_vertical_axis)",
    "explanation": "Stick inputs are interpreted in the 'body frame', meaning the vehicle will rotate about its vertical axis when yaw is applied."
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(Acro_Trainer_enabled → automatic_leveling)",
    "explanation": "When Acro Trainer is enabled, the vehicle will automatically return to level when the pilot releases the sticks."
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G(Acro_Trainer_enabled ∧ lean_angle_limited → vehicle_will_not_lean_more_than_45_degrees)",
    "explanation": "When Acro Trainer is enabled and lean angle limited, the vehicle will not lean more than 45 degrees."
  },
  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(Airmode_enabled → full_stabilization_at_idle_throttle)",
    "explanation": "When Airmode is enabled, the vehicle will provide full stabilization at idle throttle."
  },
  {
    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G(RTL_switched → reliable_position_estimate_required)",
    "explanation": "When switching to RTL, a reliable position estimate is required."

  {
    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G(INS_GYRO_FILTER_cutoff_frequency_raised → better_responsiveness)",
    "explanation": "Raising the INS_GYRO_FILTER cutoff frequency may allow better responsiveness, but requires appropriate harmonic notch filtering."

  {
    "index": 7,
    "formula": "G(pure_rate_mode_stabilization → no_attitude_feedback_from_accelerometers)",
    "explanation": "In pure rate mode stabilization, only the gyros are used with no attitude feedback from the accelerometers."
