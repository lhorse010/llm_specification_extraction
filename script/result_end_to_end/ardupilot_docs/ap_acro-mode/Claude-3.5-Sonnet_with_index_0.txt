    "formula": "G(acro_trainer = 1 → F(attitude = level))",
    "explanation": "Globally, if Acro Trainer is set to 1 (automatic leveling), then eventually the vehicle's attitude will return to level when the pilot releases the sticks."

    "formula": "G(acro_trainer = 2 → (F(attitude = level) ∧ G(lean_angle ≤ 45)))",
    "explanation": "Globally, if Acro Trainer is set to 2 (automatic leveling and lean angle limited), then eventually the attitude will return to level and the lean angle will always be less than or equal to 45 degrees."
