Based on the provided document, I have extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_manual → no_compensation_for_tilt_angle)",
            "explanation": "The throttle is completely manual with no compensation for tilt angle of the vehicle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(stick_inputs_interpreted_in_body_frame → vehicle_rotates_about_vertical_axis)",
            "explanation": "Stick inputs are interpreted in the 'body frame', meaning the vehicle will rotate about its vertical axis when yaw is applied."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Acro_Trainer_enabled → automatic_leveling)",
            "explanation": "When Acro Trainer is enabled, the vehicle will automatically return to level when the pilot releases the sticks."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Acro_Trainer_enabled ∧ lean_angle_limited → vehicle_will_not_lean_more_than_45_degrees)",
            "explanation": "When Acro Trainer is enabled and lean angle limited, the vehicle will not lean more than 45 degrees."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Airmode_enabled → full_stabilization_at_idle_throttle)",
            "explanation": "When Airmode is enabled, the vehicle will provide full stabilization at idle throttle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_switched → reliable_position_estimate_required)",
            "explanation": "When switching to RTL, a reliable position estimate is required."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(INS_GYRO_FILTER_cutoff_frequency_raised → better_responsiveness)",
            "explanation": "Raising the INS_GYRO_FILTER cutoff frequency may allow better responsiveness, but requires appropriate harmonic notch filtering."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(pure_rate_mode_stabilization → no_attitude_feedback_from_accelerometers)",
            "explanation": "In pure rate mode stabilization, only the gyros are used with no attitude feedback from the accelerometers."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `G` for "globally" (i.e., always true)
* `→` for "implies"
* `∧` for "and"
* `∨` for "or" (not used in this example)
* `¬` for "not" (not used in this example)
* `X` for "next" (not used in this example)
* `U` for "until" (not used in this example)
* `F` for "finally" (not used in this example)

Also, I have used the following predicates:

* `throttle_manual`: The throttle is completely manual.
* `no_compensation_for_tilt_angle`: There is no compensation for tilt angle of the vehicle.
* `stick_inputs_interpreted_in_body_frame`: Stick inputs are interpreted in the "body frame".
* `vehicle_rotates_about_vertical_axis`: The vehicle rotates about its vertical axis when yaw is applied.
* `Acro_Trainer_enabled`: Acro Trainer is enabled.
* `automatic_leveling`: The vehicle will automatically return to level when the pilot releases the sticks.
* `lean_angle_limited`: The vehicle will not lean more than 45 degrees.
* `Airmode_enabled`: Airmode is enabled.
* `full_stabilization_at_idle_throttle`: The vehicle will provide full stabilization at idle throttle.
* `RTL_switched`: RTL is switched.
* `reliable_position_estimate_required`: A reliable position estimate is required.
* `INS_GYRO_FILTER_cutoff_frequency_raised`: The INS_GYRO_FILTER cutoff frequency is raised.
* `better_responsiveness`: Better responsiveness is allowed.
* `pure_rate_mode_stabilization`: Pure rate mode stabilization is used.
* `no_attitude_feedback_from_accelerometers`: No attitude feedback from the accelerometers is used.
