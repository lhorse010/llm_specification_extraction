Based on the provided document, I have extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_manual -> X(motors_minimum_rate))",
            "explanation": "If the throttle is completely manual, then the motors will go to their minimum rate in the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(airmode_enabled -> G(full_stabilization))",
            "explanation": "If AirMode is enabled, then full stabilization will always be provided."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(acro_trainer_disabled -> G(no_automatic_leveling))",
            "explanation": "If the Acro Trainer is disabled, then no automatic leveling will be performed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(acro_trainer_enabled -> F(automatic_leveling))",
            "explanation": "If the Acro Trainer is enabled, then automatic leveling will eventually be performed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(roll_pitch_rate_control -> X(rotation_rate_control))",
            "explanation": "If the roll and pitch rates are controlled, then the rotation rate will be controlled in the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(yaw_rate_control -> X(rotation_rate_control))",
            "explanation": "If the yaw rate is controlled, then the rotation rate will be controlled in the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(expo_applied -> X(stick_response_control))",
            "explanation": "If exponential is applied to the pilot's stick inputs, then the stick response will be controlled in the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(max_acceleration_reached -> X(error_reduction))",
            "explanation": "If the maximum acceleration is reached, then error reduction will be performed in the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(attitude_control_priority -> X(throttle_control_balance))",
            "explanation": "If attitude control has priority, then throttle control will be balanced in the next time step."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `throttle_manual`: The throttle is completely manual.
* `motors_minimum_rate`: The motors are at their minimum rate.
* `airmode_enabled`: AirMode is enabled.
* `full_stabilization`: Full stabilization is provided.
* `acro_trainer_disabled`: The Acro Trainer is disabled.
* `no_automatic_leveling`: No automatic leveling is performed.
* `acro_trainer_enabled`: The Acro Trainer is enabled.
* `automatic_leveling`: Automatic leveling is performed.
* `roll_pitch_rate_control`: The roll and pitch rates are controlled.
* `rotation_rate_control`: The rotation rate is controlled.
* `yaw_rate_control`: The yaw rate is controlled.
* `expo_applied`: Exponential is applied to the pilot's stick inputs.
* `stick_response_control`: The stick response is controlled.
* `max_acceleration_reached`: The maximum acceleration is reached.
* `error_reduction`: Error reduction is performed.
* `attitude_control_priority`: Attitude control has priority.
* `throttle_control_balance`: Throttle control is balanced.

These abbreviations are used to make the MTL formulas more readable and concise.
