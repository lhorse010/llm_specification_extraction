    "index": 0,
    "formula": "G (throttle_down → motors_min_rate)",
    "explanation": "If the throttle is completely down, the motors will go to their minimum rate, and stabilization will cease."
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G (¬GPS_available → ¬switch_to_RTL)",
    "explanation": "Switching to RTL in case of emergency requires GPS; therefore, RTL cannot be activated without a reliable GPS fix."

    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G (ACRO_TRAINER = 1 → F(level_return))",
    "explanation": "If ACRO_TRAINER is set to 1, the vehicle will automatically return to level when the pilot releases the sticks."
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G (ACRO_TRAINER = 2 → F(level_return ∧ angle_limit ≤ 45))",
    "explanation": "If ACRO_TRAINER is set to 2, the vehicle will automatically return to level and will not lean more than 45 degrees."

    "explanation": "The trainer can be enabled/disabled using switches: below 1200 PWM disables it, 1200 to 1800 PWM enables option 1, and above 1800 PWM enables option 2."

    "explanation": "Setting ATC_ACCEL_R_MAX helps reduce error during rapid roll maneuvers to prevent overshoot and bounce-back."
