    "formula": "G(throttle = 0 → X(motor_rate = min_rate))",
    "explanation": "Globally, if the throttle is completely down (0), then in the next state, the motors will go to their minimum rate."

  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G(stick_input ∧ ¬acro_trainer → angular_velocity_control)",
    "explanation": "Globally, when stick input is given and Acro Trainer is not enabled, the vehicle controls angular velocity in each axis."
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(¬stick_input → attitude_hold)",
    "explanation": "Globally, when there is no stick input, the vehicle maintains its current attitude (attitude hold)."
  },

    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G(acro_trainer = 1 → (¬stick_input → F(level_attitude)))",
    "explanation": "Globally, when Acro Trainer is set to 1 (automatic leveling), if there is no stick input, the vehicle will eventually return to a level attitude."

  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(acro_trainer = 2 → (lean_angle ≤ 45 ∨ lean_angle ≤ ANGLE_MAX))",
    "explanation": "Globally, when Acro Trainer is set to 2 (leveling and lean angle limited), the lean angle is always less than or equal to 45 degrees or the value set by ANGLE_MAX parameter."

    "formula": "G(pure_rate_mode → ¬accelerometer_feedback)",
    "explanation": "Globally, when pure rate mode is enabled (ACRO_OPTIONS bit 1 set to 1), there is no attitude feedback from accelerometers."
