    "explanation": "Globally, if the throttle is completely down (0), then in the next state, the motors will go to their minimum rate and stabilization will cease. This corresponds to the specification: 'If the pilot puts the throttle completely down the motors will go to their minimum rate and stabilization will cease.'"

    "explanation": "Globally, if acro_trainer is set to 1 (automatic leveling), then eventually the attitude will return to level. This represents the specification: 'The vehicle will automatically return to the level when the pilot releases the sticks.'"

    "explanation": "Globally, if acro_trainer is set to 2 (automatic leveling and lean angle limited), then it's always true that the lean angle is less than or equal to 45 degrees.

    "explanation": "This formula represents the channel switch logic for enabling/disabling the acro trainer. It states that globally, if the RC channel option is less than 1200, acro_trainer is disabled (0); if it's between 1200 and 1800, acro_trainer is set to automatic leveling (1); and if it's 1800 or above, acro_trainer is set to leveling and lean angle limited (2)."
