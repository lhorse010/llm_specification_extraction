Here are the extracted specifications expressed in Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G (¬(throttle = 0) → stabilization = active)",
            "explanation": "If the throttle is not completely down, stabilization should remain active."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (ACRO_TRAINER = 1 → F[0,∞) (attitude = level))",
            "explanation": "If the Acro Trainer is set to automatic leveling, the vehicle should eventually return to level."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G ((ACRO_TRAINER = 2 ∧ lean_angle > 45) → ¬(lean_angle > 45))",
            "explanation": "If the Acro Trainer is set to option 2, the vehicle should not lean more than 45 degrees."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (ACRO_OPTIONS[1] = 1 → X (attitude = drift))",
            "explanation": "If pure rate mode stabilization is forced, attitude can drift over time."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (ACRO_RP_RATE = 4.5 → X (rotation_rate = 200deg/sec))",
            "explanation": "If the ACRO_RP_RATE is set to 4.5, it commands a 200 degrees per second rotation rate for roll and pitch."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (ACRO_Y_RATE = 4.5 → X (yaw_rate = 200deg/sec))",
            "explanation": "If the ACRO_Y_RATE is set to 4.5, it commands a 200 degrees per second rotation rate for yaw."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (ACRO_TRAINER = 2 → (lean_angle ≤ 45))",
            "explanation": "If Acro Trainer option 2 is enabled, the lean angle should be limited to 45 degrees."
        }
