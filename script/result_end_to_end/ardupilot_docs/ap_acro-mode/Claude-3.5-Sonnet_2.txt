Based on the provided document, I will extract the relevant specifications for the vehicle in Acro Mode and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here's the output in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle = 0 → X(motor_rate = min_rate))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the throttle is completely down (0), then in the next state, the motors will go to their minimum rate."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(stick_input ∧ ¬acro_trainer → angular_velocity_control)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when stick input is given and Acro Trainer is not enabled, the vehicle controls angular velocity in each axis."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(¬stick_input → attitude_hold)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when there is no stick input, the vehicle maintains its current attitude (attitude hold)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(acro_trainer = 1 → (¬stick_input → F(level_attitude)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when Acro Trainer is set to 1 (automatic leveling), if there is no stick input, the vehicle will eventually return to a level attitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(acro_trainer = 2 → (lean_angle ≤ 45 ∨ lean_angle ≤ ANGLE_MAX))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when Acro Trainer is set to 2 (leveling and lean angle limited), the lean angle is always less than or equal to 45 degrees or the value set by ANGLE_MAX parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(airmode_enabled → stabilization)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when AirMode is enabled, stabilization is maintained even at idle throttle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(pure_rate_mode → ¬accelerometer_feedback)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when pure rate mode is enabled (ACRO_OPTIONS bit 1 set to 1), there is no attitude feedback from accelerometers."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications of the vehicle in Acro Mode as described in the document. They cover aspects such as throttle behavior, angular velocity control, attitude hold, Acro Trainer functionality, lean angle limitations, AirMode, and pure rate mode stabilization.
