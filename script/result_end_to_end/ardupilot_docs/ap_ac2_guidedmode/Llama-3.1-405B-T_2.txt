After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(altitude > 0 → velocity_z <= WPNAV_SPEED_UP)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's vertical speed up should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED_UP parameter when the altitude is above 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(altitude > 0 → velocity_z >= -WPNAV_SPEED_DN)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's vertical speed down should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED_DN parameter when the altitude is above 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(velocity_x^2 + velocity_y^2 <= WPNAV_SPEED^2)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's horizontal speed should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(command_received → X(velocity_x = 0 ∧ velocity_y = 0 ∧ velocity_z = 0))",
            "explanation": "If no commands are received from the companion computer for GUID_TIMEOUT seconds, the vehicle should slow to a stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(command_received → X(altitude = current_altitude ∧ velocity_x = 0 ∧ velocity_y = 0 ∧ velocity_z = 0))",
            "explanation": "If no commands are received from the companion computer for GUID_TIMEOUT seconds and attitude commands were provided, the vehicle should hold a level hover."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(guided_mode → F(position_error < threshold))",
            "explanation": "In guided mode, the vehicle should eventually reach the target location within a certain threshold."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(guided_mode → G(position_error < threshold → velocity_x = 0 ∧ velocity_y = 0 ∧ velocity_z = 0))",
            "explanation": "In guided mode, once the vehicle reaches the target location within a certain threshold, it should hover at that location."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations:

* `G` for "globally" (i.e., always true)
* `F` for "finally" (i.e., true at some point in the future)
* `X` for "next" (i.e., true at the next time step)
* `→` for "implies"
* `∧` for "and"
* `∨` for "or"
* `¬` for "not"
* `velocity_x`, `velocity_y`, `velocity_z` for the vehicle's velocity components
* `altitude` for the vehicle's altitude
* `position_error` for the error between the vehicle's current position and the target position
* `threshold` for a small threshold value
* `command_received` for a boolean indicating whether a command has been received from the companion computer
* `current_altitude` for the vehicle's current altitude
* `WPNAV_SPEED_UP`, `WPNAV_SPEED_DN`, `WPNAV_SPEED` for the parameters controlling the vehicle's speed
* `GUID_TIMEOUT` for the timeout parameter in seconds

Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or modify any of these specifications.
