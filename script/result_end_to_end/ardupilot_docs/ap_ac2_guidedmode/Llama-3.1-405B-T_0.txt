After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(altitude > 0 → velocity_z <= WPNAV_SPEED_UP)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's vertical speed up should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED_UP parameter when the altitude is above 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(altitude > 0 → velocity_z >= -WPNAV_SPEED_DN)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's vertical speed down should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED_DN parameter when the altitude is above 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(velocity_x^2 + velocity_y^2 <= WPNAV_SPEED^2)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's horizontal speed should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(guided_mode → (velocity_x = 0 ∧ velocity_y = 0 ∧ velocity_z = 0) U (target_location_reached ∧ hover))",
            "explanation": "In guided mode, the vehicle should fly to the target location and wait there until another location is entered or the mode is switched."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(guided_mode → (target_location_reached → hover))",
            "explanation": "In guided mode, the vehicle should hover at the target location once it is reached."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(guided_mode ∧ no_GPS → (attitude_targets_accepted ∧ ¬position_targets_accepted ∧ ¬velocity_targets_accepted))",
            "explanation": "In guided mode without GPS, the vehicle should only accept attitude targets and not position or velocity targets."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(guided_mode ∧ timeout_expired → (velocity_x = 0 ∧ velocity_y = 0 ∧ velocity_z = 0))",
            "explanation": "In guided mode, if no commands are received from the companion computer for the specified timeout period, the vehicle should slow to a stop or hold a level hover."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `G` for "globally"
* `U` for "until"
* `→` for "implies"
* `∧` for "and"
* `¬` for "not"
* `velocity_x`, `velocity_y`, and `velocity_z` for the vehicle's velocities in the x, y, and z axes, respectively
* `altitude` for the vehicle's altitude
* `WPNAV_SPEED_UP` and `WPNAV_SPEED_DN` for the vertical speed up and down parameters, respectively
* `WPNAV_SPEED` for the horizontal speed parameter
* `guided_mode` for the guided mode state
* `target_location_reached` for the state where the vehicle has reached the target location
* `hover` for the state where the vehicle is hovering
* `no_GPS` for the state where the vehicle does not have GPS
* `attitude_targets_accepted`, `position_targets_accepted`, and `velocity_targets_accepted` for the states where the vehicle accepts attitude, position, and velocity targets, respectively
* `timeout_expired` for the state where the timeout period has expired.
