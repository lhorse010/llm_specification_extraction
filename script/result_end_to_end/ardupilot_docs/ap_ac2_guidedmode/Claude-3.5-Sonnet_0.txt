I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the output in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(GuidedMode → F(ReachTarget ∧ Hover))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in Guided Mode, the copter will eventually reach the target location and hover there."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(TakeOff → (Loiter U GuidedMode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, after takeoff, the copter should remain in Loiter mode until Guided Mode is activated."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(GuidedMode ∧ NewTargetSet → F(ReachNewTarget))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in Guided Mode and a new target is set, the copter will eventually reach the new target."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Speed ≤ WPNAV_SPEED)",
            "explanation": "Globally, the copter's horizontal speed should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(VerticalSpeedUp ≤ WPNAV_SPEED_UP)",
            "explanation": "Globally, the copter's upward vertical speed should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED_UP parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(VerticalSpeedDown ≤ WPNAV_SPEED_DN)",
            "explanation": "Globally, the copter's downward vertical speed should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED_DN parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(GuidedMode ∧ NoCommandReceived → F[0,GUID_TIMEOUT](SlowToStop ∨ HoldLevelHover))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in Guided Mode and no commands are received, within GUID_TIMEOUT seconds, the copter will either slow to a stop or hold a level hover."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Guided_NoGPS → ¬RequireGPS)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in Guided_NoGPS mode, GPS is not required for operation."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the document, focusing on the behavior of the copter in Guided Mode and its variations. The formulas express temporal relationships and constraints on the copter's actions and parameters.
