After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(altitude > 0 → velocity_z <= WPNAV_SPEED_UP)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's vertical speed up should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED_UP parameter when the altitude is above 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(altitude > 0 → velocity_z >= -WPNAV_SPEED_DN)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's vertical speed down should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED_DN parameter when the altitude is above 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(velocity_x^2 + velocity_y^2 <= WPNAV_SPEED^2)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's horizontal speed should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(command_received → X(velocity_x^2 + velocity_y^2 <= WPNAV_SPEED^2))",
            "explanation": "When a command is received, the vehicle's horizontal speed should not exceed the WPNAV_SPEED parameter at the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(no_command_received U (command_received ∨ timeout))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle should wait for a command or timeout before taking any action."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(timeout → velocity_x = 0 ∧ velocity_y = 0 ∧ velocity_z = 0)",
            "explanation": "When a timeout occurs, the vehicle should stop moving."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(guided_mode → position_error_correction)",
            "explanation": "In guided mode, the vehicle should perform position error correction unless disabled by the GUID_OPTIONS parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(guided_mode → velocity_error_correction)",
            "explanation": "In guided mode, the vehicle should perform velocity error correction unless disabled by the GUID_OPTIONS parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(guided_mode ∧ weathervaning_enabled → heading_aligned_with_wind)",
            "explanation": "In guided mode with weathervaning enabled, the vehicle's heading should align with the wind direction."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `G` for "globally" (i.e., always true)
* `X` for "next" (i.e., true at the next time step)
* `U` for "until" (i.e., true until a certain condition is met)
* `→` for "implies" (i.e., if-then)
* `∧` for "and" (i.e., conjunction)
* `∨` for "or" (i.e., disjunction)
* `¬` for "not" (i.e., negation)

I have also assumed that the variables used in the MTL formulas are defined as follows:

* `altitude`: the vehicle's current altitude
* `velocity_x`, `velocity_y`, `velocity_z`: the vehicle's current velocities in the x, y, and z axes, respectively
* `WPNAV_SPEED_UP`, `WPNAV_SPEED_DN`, `WPNAV_SPEED`: the vehicle's maximum vertical speed up, down, and horizontal speed, respectively
* `command_received`: a boolean indicating whether a command has been received from the companion computer
* `timeout`: a boolean indicating whether a timeout has occurred
* `guided_mode`: a boolean indicating whether the vehicle is in guided mode
* `position_error_correction`, `velocity_error_correction`: booleans indicating whether position and velocity error correction are enabled, respectively
* `weathervaning_enabled`: a boolean indicating whether weathervaning is enabled
* `heading_aligned_with_wind`: a boolean indicating whether the vehicle's heading is aligned with the wind direction
