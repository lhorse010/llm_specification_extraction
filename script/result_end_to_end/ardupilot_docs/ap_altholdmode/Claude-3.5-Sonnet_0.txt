I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(altitude_hold_mode → (|current_altitude - desired_altitude| < ε))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in altitude hold mode, the absolute difference between the current altitude and desired altitude should always be less than some small value ε."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(40% ≤ throttle_stick ≤ 60% → X(altitude = altitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the throttle stick is between 40% and 60%, in the next state the altitude should remain the same."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_stick < 40% → X(descent_rate ≤ 2.5 m/s))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the throttle stick is below 40%, in the next state the descent rate should be at most 2.5 m/s."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_stick > 60% → X(climb_rate ≤ 2.5 m/s))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the throttle stick is above 60%, in the next state the climb rate should be at most 2.5 m/s."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(disarm_command → F(landed ∧ F(disarmed)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a disarm command is given, eventually the copter should be landed, and then eventually it should be disarmed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(altitude_hold_mode ∧ high_vibration → F(rapid_climb))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if in altitude hold mode and high vibration is detected, eventually rapid climbing may occur (this is a problem to be avoided)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(rangefinder_enabled → |actual_altitude - measured_altitude| < δ)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a rangefinder is enabled, the absolute difference between the actual altitude and measured altitude should always be less than some small value δ."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(hover_throttle > 70% → unsafe_flight_condition)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the hover throttle is above 70%, it indicates an unsafe flight condition."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications and behaviors described in the document for the Altitude Hold Mode of the copter. They include maintaining altitude, responding to throttle stick positions, descent and climb rates, disarming procedure, potential issues with vibrations, improved accuracy with rangefinder, and power requirements for safe flight.
