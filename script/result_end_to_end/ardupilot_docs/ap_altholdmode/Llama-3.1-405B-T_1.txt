Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(altitude_error -> F(corr_altitude))",
            "explanation": "The system should always correct the altitude error."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_stick_middle -> altitude_maintained)",
            "explanation": "When the throttle stick is in the middle position, the system should maintain the current altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_stick_outside_deadzone -> (climb | descend))",
            "explanation": "When the throttle stick is outside the deadzone, the system should either climb or descend."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(climb_rate <= 2.5m/s)",
            "explanation": "The climb rate should not exceed 2.5m/s."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(descend_rate <= 2.5m/s)",
            "explanation": "The descend rate should not exceed 2.5m/s."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(adequate_power -> (attitude_control & altitude_control))",
            "explanation": "The system should have adequate power to maintain attitude and altitude control."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(barometer_error -> F(corr_altitude))",
            "explanation": "The system should correct altitude errors caused by barometer errors."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(rangefinder_enabled -> accurate_altitude_maintenance)",
            "explanation": "When the rangefinder is enabled, the system should maintain accurate altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(disarming -> (landing_checker_verification & copter_landed))",
            "explanation": "When disarming, the system should verify that the copter has landed using the landing checker."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I've used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `altitude_error`: The difference between the desired altitude and the actual altitude.
* `corr_altitude`: The corrected altitude.
* `throttle_stick_middle`: The throttle stick is in the middle position.
* `altitude_maintained`: The system maintains the current altitude.
* `throttle_stick_outside_deadzone`: The throttle stick is outside the deadzone.
* `climb`: The system climbs.
* `descend`: The system descends.
* `adequate_power`: The system has adequate power.
* `attitude_control`: The system maintains attitude control.
* `altitude_control`: The system maintains altitude control.
* `barometer_error`: The barometer error.
* `rangefinder_enabled`: The rangefinder is enabled.
* `accurate_altitude_maintenance`: The system maintains accurate altitude.
* `disarming`: The system is disarming.
* `landing_checker_verification`: The landing checker verifies that the copter has landed.
* `copter_landed`: The copter has landed.
