    "formula": "G (throttle \\in [40\\%, 60\\%] → maintain_altitude)",
    "explanation": "The vehicle should maintain its current altitude if the throttle stick is in the middle range (40% to 60%)."
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G ((throttle < 40\\%) → descend_rate = -2.5m/s)",
    "explanation": "If the throttle stick is below 40%, the vehicle should descend at 2.5 meters per second."
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G ((throttle > 60\\%) → climb_rate = 2.5m/s)",
    "explanation": "If the throttle stick is above 60%, the vehicle should climb at 2.5 meters per second."

  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G (vibration_high → ¬altitude_hold)",
    "explanation": "High vibrations should prevent the altitude hold from engaging successfully."
  },
  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G (¬adequate_power → (¬altitude_control ∧ ¬attitude_control))",
    "explanation": "If there is not enough power available, the vehicle may lose control over altitude and attitude."
  },
  {
    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G (pressure_change → altitude_drift)",
    "explanation": "Changes in air pressure can cause the vehicle to drift in altitude over time."
  },
  {
    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G (close_to_ground → altitude_hold_erratic)",
    "explanation": "Altitude hold can become erratic when the vehicle is close to the ground."
