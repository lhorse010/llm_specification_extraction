After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G((Simple_Mode ∨ Super_Simple_Mode) → ¬(Acro_Mode ∨ Drift_Mode))",
            "explanation": "Simple and Super Simple modes cannot be used in combination with Acro and Drift modes."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Simple_Mode → (Pilot_Controls = Copter_Heading_At_Takeoff))",
            "explanation": "In Simple Mode, the pilot controls the copter relative to its heading at takeoff."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Super_Simple_Mode → (Pilot_Controls = Copter_Direction_From_Home))",
            "explanation": "In Super Simple Mode, the pilot controls the copter relative to its direction from home."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Super_Simple_Mode → GPS_Lock)",
            "explanation": "Super Simple Mode requires a GPS lock."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Simple_Mode ∨ Super_Simple_Mode) → (Pilot_Stick_Inputs = Copter_Movement))",
            "explanation": "In Simple and Super Simple modes, the pilot's stick inputs control the copter's movement."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Simple_Mode ∨ Super_Simple_Mode) → (Yaw_Input → Copter_Spin))",
            "explanation": "In Simple and Super Simple modes, yaw input causes the copter to spin."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Super_Simple_Mode → (Pitch_Back → Copter_Returns_Home))",
            "explanation": "In Super Simple Mode, pulling the pitch back causes the copter to return home."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Super_Simple_Mode → (Roll_Input → Copter_Circles_Around_Pilot))",
            "explanation": "In Super Simple Mode, roll input causes the copter to circle around the pilot."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `Simple_Mode`: The copter is in Simple Mode.
* `Super_Simple_Mode`: The copter is in Super Simple Mode.
* `Acro_Mode`: The copter is in Acro Mode.
* `Drift_Mode`: The copter is in Drift Mode.
* `Pilot_Controls`: The pilot's controls are relative to the copter's heading or direction.
* `Copter_Heading_At_Takeoff`: The copter's heading at takeoff.
* `Copter_Direction_From_Home`: The copter's direction from home.
* `GPS_Lock`: The copter has a GPS lock.
* `Pilot_Stick_Inputs`: The pilot's stick inputs.
* `Copter_Movement`: The copter's movement.
* `Yaw_Input`: The pilot's yaw input.
* `Copter_Spin`: The copter spins.
* `Pitch_Back`: The pilot pulls the pitch back.
* `Copter_Returns_Home`: The copter returns home.
* `Roll_Input`: The pilot's roll input.
* `Copter_Circles_Around_Pilot`: The copter circles around the pilot.
