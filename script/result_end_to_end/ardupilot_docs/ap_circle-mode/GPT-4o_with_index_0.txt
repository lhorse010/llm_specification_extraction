    "explanation": "If the circle radius is set to zero, the copter will eventually rotate in place with its nose pointed at the circle's center."

    "formula": "G(CIRCLE_RATE > 0 → F(clockwise_rotation))",
    "explanation": "A positive circle rate indicates the vehicle will eventually rotate clockwise."

    "formula": "G((bit_0_set ∧ pitch_stick_down) → F(radius_increases))",
    "explanation": "If bit 0 is set and the pitch stick is moved down, the circle's radius will eventually increase."

    "explanation": "Roll stick rate changes are inhibited when the CH6 tuning knob is set for circle rate."
