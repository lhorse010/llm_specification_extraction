After carefully reading the document, I extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(CIRCLE_RADIUS >= 0)",
            "explanation": "The circle radius should always be greater than or equal to 0."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(CIRCLE_RATE > 0 -> rotate_clockwise)",
            "explanation": "If the circle rate is positive, the vehicle should rotate clockwise."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(CIRCLE_RATE < 0 -> rotate_counter_clockwise)",
            "explanation": "If the circle rate is negative, the vehicle should rotate counter-clockwise."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(acceleration <= WPNAV_ACCEL)",
            "explanation": "The acceleration towards the center of the circle should never exceed the maximum acceleration held in the WPNAV_ACCEL parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((CIRCLE_CONTROL = 1) -> (stick_adjustment_enabled))",
            "explanation": "If the CIRCLE_CONTROL parameter is enabled, the pilot should be able to adjust the circle's radius and angular velocity using the control sticks."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((CIRCLE_OPTIONS bit 0 = 1) -> (pilot_can_adjust_radius_and_velocity))",
            "explanation": "If bit 0 of the CIRCLE_OPTIONS parameter is set, the pilot should be able to adjust the circle's radius and angular velocity using the control sticks."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((CIRCLE_OPTIONS bit 1 = 1) -> (copter_faces_direction_of_travel))",
            "explanation": "If bit 1 of the CIRCLE_OPTIONS parameter is set, the copter should face the direction of travel as it circles."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((CIRCLE_OPTIONS bit 2 = 1) -> (circle_center_position_set_upon_mode_entry))",
            "explanation": "If bit 2 of the CIRCLE_OPTIONS parameter is set, the circle's center position should be set upon mode entry at the current location."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((CIRCLE_OPTIONS bit 3 = 1) -> (mount_faces_circle_center))",
            "explanation": "If bit 3 of the CIRCLE_OPTIONS parameter is set, the mount's ROI should be set on the circle center, causing the mount to face the circle's center all the time."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(pilot_has_control_over_altitude)",
            "explanation": "The pilot should always have control over the altitude using the throttle stick."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(pilot_has_control_over_yaw)",
            "explanation": "The pilot should always have control over the yaw of the copter."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I excluded some specifications that were not clear or specific enough to be expressed using MTL formulas. Additionally, I assumed that the `rotate_clockwise` and `rotate_counter_clockwise` predicates are defined elsewhere in the system.
