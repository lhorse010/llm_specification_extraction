I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the converted sentences in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(flip_triggered → (X[0,1] rise ∧ X[1,∞] rapid_flip))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when a flip is triggered, the vehicle will rise for 1 second and then rapidly flip."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flip_completed → (¬flip_possible U switch_low_then_high))",
            "explanation": "Globally, after a flip is completed, another flip is not possible until the switch is brought low and then back to high."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flip_mode_active → (stabilize ∨ acro ∨ althold))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when flip mode is active, the vehicle must be in Stabilize, Acro, or AltHold flight mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flip_triggered → F[0,2.5] flip_completed)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when a flip is triggered, it should complete within 2.5 seconds."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flip_completed → X return_to_original_mode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when a flip is completed, the vehicle will return to the original flight mode it was in before the flip was triggered."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((ch7_ch8_switch_off ∨ roll_stick_over_40deg) → flip_exit)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the ch7/ch8 switch is turned off or the roll stick is moved to over 40 degrees left or right, the flip will be manually exited."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flip_start → (lean_angle < 45 ∧ roll_right_400deg_sec ∧ increase_throttle))",
            "explanation": "Globally, during the Flip_Start state (while copter is leaning <45deg), the vehicle will roll right at 400deg/sec and increase throttle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flip_roll → (45 ≤ lean_angle ≤ 90 ∧ roll_right_400deg_sec ∧ reduce_throttle))",
            "explanation": "Globally, during the Flip_Roll state (while copter is between +45deg ~ -90deg), the vehicle will roll right at 400deg/sec and reduce throttle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flip_recover → (-90 < lean_angle < original_target_angle ∧ use_earth_frame_angle_controller))",
            "explanation": "Globally, during the Flip_Recover state (while copter is between -90deg and original target angle), the vehicle will use earth frame angle controller to return to the original attitude."
        }
    ]
}

This JSON output contains the extracted specifications from the document, expressed using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Each specification includes the formula and an explanation of its meaning in the context of the flip mode functionality for the vehicle.
