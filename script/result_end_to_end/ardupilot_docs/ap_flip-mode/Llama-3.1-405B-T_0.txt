After carefully reading the document, I extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required output format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G((ch7/ch8_switch = ON) ∧ (roll/pitch_stick_position ≠ 0) → X(roll/pitch_flip))",
            "explanation": "Whenever the ch7/ch8 switch is ON and the roll/pitch stick position is not zero, the vehicle will flip on its roll or pitch axis in the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flip_start → X(rise_for_1_second ∧ F(rapid_flip)))",
            "explanation": "Whenever the flip mode is started, the vehicle will rise for 1 second and then rapidly flip in the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flip → X(G(¬flip) U (ch7/ch8_switch = OFF ∧ ch7/ch8_switch = ON)))",
            "explanation": "After flipping, the vehicle will not flip again until the ch7/ch8 switch is brought low and back to high."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((roll/pitch_stick_position > 40deg) → X(exit_flip))",
            "explanation": "If the roll/pitch stick position exceeds 40 degrees, the vehicle will exit the flip mode in the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flip_start → F(complete_roll_within_2.5sec))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will complete the roll within 2.5 seconds after starting the flip mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(flip_recover → F(return_to_original_attitude))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will return to its original attitude after recovering from the flip."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I excluded vague specifications and focused on clear and specific requirements. I also used the MTL operators to express the temporal relationships between events, such as "X" for next, "U" for until, "G" for globally, and "F" for finally.
