    "explanation": "The vehicle must not lean more than 45 degrees in any direction. This is controlled by the ACRO_BAL_ROLL and ACRO_BAL_PITCH parameters."

    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G (sticks_released → X (attitude = current_attitude))",
    "explanation": "When the pilot releases the roll, pitch, and yaw sticks, the vehicle should maintain its current attitude."

    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G ((|throttle - mid_throttle| <= 0.1) → F (altitude = current_altitude))",
    "explanation": "When the throttle is within 10% of mid-throttle, the vehicle should eventually hold its current altitude."

    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G ((throttle > mid_throttle + 0.1) → F (climb_rate <= 2.5))",
    "explanation": "If the throttle is above 10% of mid-throttle, the vehicle's climb rate should not exceed 2.5 m/s."
