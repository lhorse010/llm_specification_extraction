  {
    "index": 0,
    "formula": "G (right_stick_centered → F[0,2] speed_brake_active)",
    "explanation": "If the right stick is centered, a speed brake is activated, slowing the copter to a stop within two seconds."
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G (right_stick_forward ∨ right_stick_back → pitch_and_accelerate)",
    "explanation": "Pushing the right stick forward or back causes the copter to pitch and accelerate in the appropriate direction."
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G (right_stick_side → (yaw_auto_applied ∧ roll_cancel_velocity))",
    "explanation": "When the right stick is pushed to the side, yaw is automatically applied and roll is adjusted to cancel velocity in the roll axis, ensuring a coordinated turn."
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G (¬GPS_signal → (F[0,∞] (land ∨ altitude_hold)))",
    "explanation": "If the GPS signal is lost, the copter will eventually land or enter altitude hold, depending on the failsafe settings."
  },
  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G (throttle_down → (motors_min_rate ∧ lose_attitude_control))",
    "explanation": "If the throttle is completely down, the motors go to their minimum rate, causing the copter to lose attitude control and tumble."
