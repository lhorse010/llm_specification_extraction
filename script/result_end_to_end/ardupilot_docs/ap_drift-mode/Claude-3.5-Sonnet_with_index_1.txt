  {
    "index": 0,
    "formula": "G(pitch_control ∧ yaw_control ∧ ¬roll_control)",
    "explanation": "The user always has direct control of Pitch and Yaw, but Roll is controlled by the autopilot."
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G(manual_throttle_control)",
    "explanation": "The user always has completely manual control over the throttle, similar to Stabilize mode."
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(forward_stick → X(pitch_forward ∧ accelerate_forward))",
    "explanation": "When the right stick is pushed forward, the copter will pitch and accelerate in the forward direction in the next state."
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G(backward_stick → X(pitch_backward ∧ accelerate_backward))",
    "explanation": "When the right stick is pushed backward, the copter will pitch and accelerate in the backward direction in the next state."
  },
  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(right_stick → X(turn_right ∧ bank_right))",
    "explanation": "When the right stick is pushed to the right, the copter will turn and bank to the right in the next state."
  },
  {
    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G(left_stick → X(turn_left ∧ bank_left))",
    "explanation": "When the right stick is pushed to the left, the copter will turn and bank to the left in the next state."
  },
  {
    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G(turning → (auto_yaw ∧ auto_roll_compensation))",
    "explanation": "During turns, yaw is automatically applied and sufficient roll is added to cancel the copter's velocity in the roll axis."
  },
  {
    "index": 7,
    "formula": "G(sticks_released → F[0,2](velocity ≈ 0))",
    "explanation": "When the sticks are released, the copter's velocity will approach zero within 2 seconds."
  },
  {
    "index": 8,
    "formula": "G(center_stick → weak_position_hold)",
    "explanation": "When the right stick is in the center position, the copter will loosely hold its horizontal position, allowing for slow drift in wind."
  },
  {
    "index": 9,
    "formula": "G(throttle_down → (motors_min_speed ∧ ¬attitude_control))",
    "explanation": "When throttle is completely down, motors will go to their minimum rate and the vehicle will lose attitude control."
  },
  {
    "index": 10,
    "formula": "G(¬gps_signal → (land ∨ altitude_hold))",
    "explanation": "If GPS signal is lost, the copter will either land or enter altitude hold based on the failsafe_gps_enabled setting."
