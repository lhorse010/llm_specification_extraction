I've analyzed the document and extracted the relevant specifications for the Drift Mode in a multi-copter. I'll now express these specifications using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas and provide explanations for each.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(drift_mode_active → (manual_throttle ∧ autopilot_roll ∧ manual_yaw ∧ manual_pitch))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when Drift Mode is active, the throttle and yaw/pitch controls are manual, while roll is controlled by the autopilot."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(drift_mode_active ∧ right_stick_centered → F[0,2](velocity ≈ 0))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when Drift Mode is active and the right stick is centered, the copter's velocity will approach zero within 2 seconds (acting as a speed brake)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(drift_mode_active ∧ throttle_min → attitude_control_lost)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when Drift Mode is active and throttle is at minimum, the vehicle will lose attitude control."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(drift_mode_active ∧ gps_signal_lost → (land ∨ altitude_hold))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when Drift Mode is active and GPS signal is lost, the copter will either land or enter altitude hold mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(drift_mode_active ∧ turn_input → (yaw_applied ∧ roll_adjusted))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when Drift Mode is active and turn input is given, yaw will be automatically applied and roll will be adjusted to maintain a coordinated turn."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(drift_mode_active → X(position_hold_loose))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when Drift Mode is active, in the next state, the copter will loosely hold its horizontal position (allowing for slow drift in wind)."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications of the Drift Mode as described in the document. They focus on the behavior of the copter in various situations, including control inputs, GPS signal loss, and the automatic features of the mode. The formulas use the temporal operators to express the continuous nature of these specifications throughout the flight.
