Based on the provided document, I have extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> F(altitude >= RTL_CLIMB_MIN))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter will eventually climb to at least RTL_CLIMB_MIN meters."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> F(altitude >= RTL_ALT))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter will eventually climb to at least RTL_ALT meters."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> altitude >= 2)",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter's altitude will always be at least 2 meters."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> F(distance_to_home <= RTL_CONE_SLOPE * altitude))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter will eventually be within a distance of RTL_CONE_SLOPE * altitude from the home location."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> F(altitude <= RTL_ALT_FINAL))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter will eventually descend to at most RTL_ALT_FINAL meters."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> F(loiter_time >= RTL_LOIT_TIME))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter will eventually loiter for at least RTL_LOIT_TIME milliseconds."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> F(landing_speed <= LAND_SPEED))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter's landing speed will eventually be at most LAND_SPEED centimeters per second."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> F(horizontal_speed <= RTL_SPEED))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter's horizontal speed will eventually be at most RTL_SPEED centimeters per second."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> F(yaw_behavior == WP_YAW_BEHAVIOR))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter's yaw behavior will eventually be WP_YAW_BEHAVIOR."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RTL_mode -> F(home_location == GPS_takeoff_location))",
            "explanation": "When RTL mode is selected, the copter's home location will eventually be the GPS takeoff location."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `RTL_mode`: RTL mode is selected
* `altitude`: the copter's current altitude
* `RTL_CLIMB_MIN`: the minimum altitude the copter will climb to
* `RTL_ALT`: the target altitude for RTL mode
* `RTL_CONE_SLOPE`: the slope of the inverted cone above the home location
* `distance_to_home`: the distance from the copter to the home location
* `RTL_ALT_FINAL`: the final altitude for RTL mode
* `RTL_LOIT_TIME`: the loiter time for RTL mode
* `LAND_SPEED`: the landing speed for RTL mode
* `RTL_SPEED`: the horizontal speed for RTL mode
* `WP_YAW_BEHAVIOR`: the yaw behavior for RTL mode
* `home_location`: the copter's home location
* `GPS_takeoff_location`: the GPS takeoff location

Also, I have used the following logical operators:

* `G`: globally (always)
* `F`: finally (eventually)
* `->`: implies
* `>=` : greater than or equal to
* `<=` : less than or equal to
* `==` : equal to

Please note that these formulas are based on my understanding of the provided document and may need to be adjusted or refined based on further clarification or additional information.
