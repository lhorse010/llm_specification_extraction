Based on the provided document, I will extract the specifications and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

Here are the extracted specifications:

1. The vehicle stops as soon as possible when Brake mode is invoked.
2. The vehicle does not accept any input from the pilot when Brake mode is invoked.
3. Brake mode requires GPS.
4. The vehicle is subject to acceleration and angle limits imposed by the position and attitude controllers.
5. The vehicle disarms immediately if it is landed in Brake mode.

Here are the MTL formulas for the extracted specifications:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(BrakeMode → F(Stopped))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if Brake mode is invoked, then the vehicle will eventually stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(BrakeMode → ¬PilotInput)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if Brake mode is invoked, then the vehicle does not accept any input from the pilot."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(BrakeMode → GPS)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if Brake mode is invoked, then GPS is required."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(BrakeMode → (AccelerationLimit ∧ AngleLimit))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if Brake mode is invoked, then the vehicle is subject to acceleration and angle limits imposed by the position and attitude controllers."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Landed ∧ BrakeMode → X(Disarmed))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is landed and Brake mode is invoked, then the vehicle will disarm immediately in the next state."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* BrakeMode: Brake mode is invoked
* Stopped: The vehicle is stopped
* PilotInput: The pilot is providing input
* GPS: GPS is available
* AccelerationLimit: The vehicle is within acceleration limits
* AngleLimit: The vehicle is within angle limits
* Landed: The vehicle is landed
* Disarmed: The vehicle is disarmed

Also, I have used the `G` operator to express the global behavior of the system, and the `F` operator to express the eventual behavior of the system. The `X` operator is used to express the immediate behavior of the system in the next state.
