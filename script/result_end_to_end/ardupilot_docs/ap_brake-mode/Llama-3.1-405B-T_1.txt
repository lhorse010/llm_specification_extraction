Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet in Brake Mode and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

Here are the extracted specifications in JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(BrakeMode → ¬PilotInput)",
            "explanation": "Once Brake Mode is invoked, the vehicle does not accept any input from the pilot."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(BrakeMode → GPSRequired)",
            "explanation": "Brake Mode requires GPS to function."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(BrakeMode → (AccelerationLimit ∧ AngleLimit))",
            "explanation": "Brake Mode is subject to acceleration and angle limits imposed by the position and attitude controllers."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(Landed ∧ BrakeMode → F(Disarmed))",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle is landed in Brake Mode, it will immediately disarm."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(BrakeMode → ¬PilotControl)",
            "explanation": "The pilot's controls are ignored in Brake Mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(BrakeMode → F(VehicleStopped))",
            "explanation": "When switched on, Brake Mode will attempt to stop the vehicle as quickly as possible."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I've used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `BrakeMode`: The vehicle is in Brake Mode.
* `PilotInput`: The pilot is providing input to the vehicle.
* `GPSRequired`: GPS is required for the vehicle to function.
* `AccelerationLimit`: The vehicle's acceleration is within the allowed limits.
* `AngleLimit`: The vehicle's angle is within the allowed limits.
* `Landed`: The vehicle has landed.
* `Disarmed`: The vehicle is disarmed.
* `PilotControl`: The pilot has control of the vehicle.
* `VehicleStopped`: The vehicle has stopped moving.
