  {
    "index": 0,
    "formula": "G(armed → (throttle > 0 → mission_started))",
    "explanation": "The mission starts when the throttle is raised above zero, given that the copter is armed."
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G(in_air → (switch_to_auto → mission_resumed))",
    "explanation": "If the mission is started from the air, the mission will begin from the first command when the flight mode switch is moved to Auto."
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(takeoff_command ∧ above_takeoff_altitude → takeoff_command_completed)",
    "explanation": "If the first command in the mission is a take-off command but the vehicle is already above the take-off command's altitude, the take-off command will be considered completed."
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G(pilot_override → yaw_control_override)",
    "explanation": "During the mission, the pilot's yaw input can override the autopilot's yaw control."
  },
  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(next_waypoint_reached → yaw_control_autopilot)",
    "explanation": "The autopilot will attempt to retake yaw control as the vehicle passes the next waypoint."
  },
  {
    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G(mission_completed → (RTL_command ∨ LAND_command))",
    "explanation": "Missions should normally have an RTL or LAND command as their final command to ensure the copter will return or land after the mission completes."
  },
  {
    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G(final_waypoint_reached ∧ ¬(RTL_command ∨ LAND_command) → stop_at_final_waypoint)",
    "explanation": "Without a final RTL or LAND command, the copter will simply stop at the final waypoint."
  },
  {
    "index": 7,
    "formula": "G(landing_detected → disarm)",
    "explanation": "As the copter touches down at the end of the mission, the vehicle should automatically disarm."
  },
  {
    "index": 8,
    "formula": "G(¬landing_detected → (throttle_down ∧ takeoff_in_another_mode → disarm))",
    "explanation": "If the vehicle does not sense the landing, the pilot may need to hold the throttle down and take off in another mode, then manually disarm the vehicle."
  },
  {
    "index": 9,
    "formula": "G(speed > WPNAV_SPEED → speed_limited)",
    "explanation": "The maximum horizontal speed of the copter is limited by the WPNAV_SPEED parameter."
  },
  {
    "index": 10,
    "formula": "G(vertical_speed > WPNAV_SPEED_UP ∨ vertical_speed < WPNAV_SPEED_DN → vertical_speed_limited)",
    "explanation": "The vertical speeds up and down are limited by the WPNAV_SPEED_UP and WPNAV_SPEED_DN parameters."
  },
  {
    "index": 11,
    "formula": "G(acceleration > WPNAV_ACCEL_Z → acceleration_limited)",
    "explanation": "The acceleration is limited by the WPNAV_ACCEL_Z parameter."
  },
  {
    "index": 12,
    "formula": "G(jerk > WPNAV_JERK → jerk_limited)",
    "explanation": "The jerk is limited by the WPNAV_JERK parameter."
  },
  {
    "index": 13,
    "formula": "G(distance_to_waypoint < WPNAV_RADIUS → waypoint_reached)",
    "explanation": "The copter must come within the WPNAV_RADIUS distance to the exact waypoint position before the waypoint is considered 'complete'."
