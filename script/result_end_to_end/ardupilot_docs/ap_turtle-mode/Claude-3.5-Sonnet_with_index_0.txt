    "formula": "G(turtle_mode_active → (throttle = 0))",
    "explanation": "Globally, if Turtle Mode is active, then the throttle must be zero. This corresponds to the specification: 'Turtle mode cannot be entered unless throttle is zero'."
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G(turtle_mode_active ∧ ¬motors_armed → notify_leds_flashing)",
    "explanation": "Globally, when Turtle Mode is active and motors are not armed, the notify LEDs should be flashing. This represents: 'Upon entry to turtle mode the motors stay disarmed, but the notify LEDs flash'."

  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(turtle_mode_active ∧ (throttle > 0) → motors_armed)",
    "explanation": "Globally, when Turtle Mode is active and throttle is raised above zero, the motors should be armed. This corresponds to: 'Raising the throttle, the motors arm'."

    "formula": "G(turtle_mode_active ∧ motors_armed ∧ (throttle > 0) → motors_spinning)",
    "explanation": "Globally, when Turtle Mode is active, motors are armed, and throttle is above zero, the motors should be spinning. This represents: 'Motors spin only when throttle is raised'."

  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(turtle_mode_active ∧ (throttle = 0) → ¬motors_armed)",
    "explanation": "Globally, when Turtle Mode is active and throttle is lowered to zero, the motors should disarm. This corresponds to: 'Lowering throttle to zero disarms the motors'."

  {
    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G(turtle_mode_active ∧ (|roll| > 0 ∨ |pitch| > 0) → F(adjacent_motors_reversed))",
    "explanation": "Globally, when Turtle Mode is active and either roll or pitch is non-zero, eventually adjacent motors should be reversed. This represents: 'Moving the roll and/or pitch stick of the transmitter away from center will reverse and spin up the designated pair of motors'."

    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G(dshot_capable_escs ∧ (SERVO_DSHOT_ESC > 0) ∧ (MOT_PWM_TYPE = DSHOT))",
    "explanation": "Globally, DShot capable ESCs are required, SERVO_DSHOT_ESC must be set to a non-zero value, and MOT_PWM_TYPE must be set to a DSHOT value. This corresponds to the requirements for Turtle Mode to function."
