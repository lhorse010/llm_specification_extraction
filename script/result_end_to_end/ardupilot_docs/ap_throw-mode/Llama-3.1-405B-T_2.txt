After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet in Throw Mode. Here are the specifications expressed using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode → ¬pilot_input)",
            "explanation": "In Throw Mode, the vehicle does not accept any input from the pilot."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode → gps_available)",
            "explanation": "Throw Mode requires GPS to be available."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(multirotor → throw_mode_available)",
            "explanation": "Throw Mode is only available for multirotors."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode → (X(motor_start) U (velocity > 5m/s ∧ vertical_velocity > 0.5m/s)))",
            "explanation": "In Throw Mode, the motors will start when the vehicle reaches the apex of its trajectory and the velocity is above 5m/s and the vertical velocity is above 0.5m/s."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode → (X(attitude_control) U (descending = 0 ∧ horizontal_velocity = 0)))",
            "explanation": "In Throw Mode, the vehicle will first try to control its attitude, then stop descending and finally stop moving horizontally."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_type = 0 → (X(motor_start) U (altitude > THROW_ALT_MIN ∧ altitude < THROW_ALT_MAX)))",
            "explanation": "If throwing the vehicle up, the motors will start when the vehicle is above the minimum altitude and below the maximum altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_type = 1 → (X(motor_start) U (altitude > 10m)))",
            "explanation": "If dropping the vehicle, the motors will start when the vehicle is above 10m altitude."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have excluded vague specifications and only included clear and specific requirements. I have also used the MTL operators to express the temporal relationships between the different events and states in the Throw Mode.
