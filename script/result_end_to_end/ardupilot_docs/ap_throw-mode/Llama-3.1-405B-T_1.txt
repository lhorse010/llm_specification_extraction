After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet in Throw Mode. Here are the specifications expressed using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode → ¬pilot_input)",
            "explanation": "In Throw Mode, the vehicle does not accept any input from the pilot."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode → gps_available)",
            "explanation": "Throw Mode requires GPS to be available."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(multirotor → throw_mode_available)",
            "explanation": "Throw Mode is only available for multirotors."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode → (X(motor_start) U (velocity > 5m/s ∧ vertical_velocity > 0.5m/s)))",
            "explanation": "In Throw Mode, the motors will start when the vehicle reaches the apex of its trajectory and the velocity is above 5m/s and the vertical velocity is above 0.5m/s."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_mode → (X(attitude_control) U (descending = 0 ∧ horizontal_velocity = 0)))",
            "explanation": "In Throw Mode, the vehicle will first try to control its attitude, then stop descending and finally stop moving horizontally."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_type = 0 → (X(motor_start) U (altitude > THROW_ALT_MIN ∧ altitude < THROW_ALT_MAX)))",
            "explanation": "If throwing the vehicle up, the motors will start when the vehicle is above the minimum altitude and below the maximum altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throw_type = 1 → (X(motor_start) U (altitude > 10m)))",
            "explanation": "If dropping the vehicle, the motors will start when the vehicle is above 10m altitude."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations:

* `throw_mode`: The vehicle is in Throw Mode.
* `pilot_input`: The pilot is providing input to the vehicle.
* `gps_available`: GPS is available.
* `multirotor`: The vehicle is a multirotor.
* `motor_start`: The motors have started.
* `velocity`: The velocity of the vehicle.
* `vertical_velocity`: The vertical velocity of the vehicle.
* `attitude_control`: The vehicle is controlling its attitude.
* `descending`: The vehicle is descending.
* `horizontal_velocity`: The horizontal velocity of the vehicle.
* `THROW_ALT_MIN` and `THROW_ALT_MAX`: The minimum and maximum altitudes for Throw Mode launch.
* `throw_type`: The type of throw (0 for throwing up, 1 for dropping).
