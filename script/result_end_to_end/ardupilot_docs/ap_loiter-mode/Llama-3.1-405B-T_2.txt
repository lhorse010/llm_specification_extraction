Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(armed → (GPS_lock ∧ HDOP < 1.4))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle can only be armed in Loiter mode if the GPS has a 3D lock and the HDOP is below 1.4."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(sticks_released → F(speed = 0))",
            "explanation": "When the pilot releases the sticks, the vehicle will slow to a stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(LOIT_SPEED > 0 → speed ≤ LOIT_SPEED)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's horizontal speed is limited by the LOIT_SPEED parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(LOIT_ACC_MAX > 0 → acceleration ≤ LOIT_ACC_MAX)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's acceleration is limited by the LOIT_ACC_MAX parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(LOIT_ANG_MAX > 0 → lean_angle ≤ LOIT_ANG_MAX)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's lean angle is limited by the LOIT_ANG_MAX parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(LOIT_BRK_ACCEL > 0 → braking_acceleration ≤ LOIT_BRK_ACCEL)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's braking acceleration is limited by the LOIT_BRK_ACCEL parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(LOIT_BRK_DELAY > 0 → (sticks_centered → F(braking_starts)))",
            "explanation": "There is a delay of LOIT_BRK_DELAY seconds before braking starts when the pilot centers the sticks."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(LOIT_BRK_JERK > 0 → braking_jerk ≤ LOIT_BRK_JERK)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's braking jerk is limited by the LOIT_BRK_JERK parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(PSC_POSXY_P > 0 → position_error ≤ PSC_POSXY_P)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's position error is converted to a desired speed using the PSC_POSXY_P parameter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(PSC_VELXY_P > 0 → velocity_error ≤ PSC_VELXY_P)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's velocity error is converted to a desired acceleration using the PSC_VELXY_P parameter."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I've used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `armed`: The vehicle is armed.
* `GPS_lock`: The GPS has a 3D lock.
* `HDOP`: The HDOP value.
* `sticks_released`: The pilot has released the sticks.
* `speed`: The vehicle's horizontal speed.
* `LOIT_SPEED`, `LOIT_ACC_MAX`, `LOIT_ANG_MAX`, `LOIT_BRK_ACCEL`, `LOIT_BRK_DELAY`, `LOIT_BRK_JERK`, `PSC_POSXY_P`, `PSC_VELXY_P`: The corresponding parameters.
* `lean_angle`: The vehicle's lean angle.
* `braking_acceleration`: The vehicle's braking acceleration.
* `braking_starts`: Braking has started.
* `position_error`: The vehicle's position error.
* `velocity_error`: The vehicle's velocity error.
