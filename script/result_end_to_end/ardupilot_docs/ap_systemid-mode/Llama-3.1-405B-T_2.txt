Based on the provided document, I will extract the specifications and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

Here are the extracted specifications:

1. The System Identification Mode will be enabled if the SID_AXIS is non-zero.
2. When the System Identification Mode is enabled, its associated parameters will become visible on the next parameter refresh.
3. If the SID_AXIS is zero, an error message will be logged and sent to the ground control station, and mode entry will be prohibited.

Here are the MTL formulas for the extracted specifications:

1. `G (SID_AXIS ≠ 0 → X (System_Identification_Mode_Enabled))`
   Explanation: Globally, if the SID_AXIS is non-zero, then at the next time step, the System Identification Mode will be enabled.

2. `G (System_Identification_Mode_Enabled → F (Parameters_Visible))`
   Explanation: Globally, if the System Identification Mode is enabled, then eventually (at some future time step), its associated parameters will become visible.

3. `G (SID_AXIS = 0 → X (Error_Message_Logged ∧ Mode_Entry_Prohibited))`
   Explanation: Globally, if the SID_AXIS is zero, then at the next time step, an error message will be logged and mode entry will be prohibited.

Here are the MTL formulas in the required JSON format:

```json

    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G (SID_AXIS ≠ 0 → X (System_Identification_Mode_Enabled))",

        },

        }
    ]
}
