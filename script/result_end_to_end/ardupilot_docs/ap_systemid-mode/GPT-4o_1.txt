I'm unable to extract and analyze the document directly. However, I can guide you on how to create specifications in Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) from the given text. Let's break it down:

### Step 4: Extract Specifications and Express Using MTL

We'll identify key requirements from the document text:

1. **Mode Activation Condition**:
   - **Specification**: If `SID_AXIS` is non-zero, associated parameters become visible and entry into the mode is allowed.
   - **MTL Formula**: 
     \[
     G(\text{SID\_AXIS} \neq 0 \rightarrow F(\text{ParametersVisible} \land \text{ModeEntryAllowed}))
     \]
   - **Explanation**: Globally, if `SID_AXIS` is non-zero, it should eventually lead to the parameters becoming visible and mode entry being allowed.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - **Specification**: If `SID_AXIS` is zero, an error message is logged and sent to the ground control station.
   - **MTL Formula**: 
     \[
     G(\text{SID\_AXIS} = 0 \rightarrow F(\text{ErrorLogged} \land \text{ErrorSent}))
     \]
   - **Explanation**: Globally, if `SID_AXIS` is zero, it should eventually result in an error being logged and sent.

### Step 5: Format in JSON

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(SID_AXIS ≠ 0 → F(ParametersVisible ∧ ModeEntryAllowed))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if SID_AXIS is non-zero, it should eventually lead to the parameters becoming visible and mode entry being allowed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(SID_AXIS = 0 → F(ErrorLogged ∧ ErrorSent))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if SID_AXIS is zero, it should eventually result in an error being logged and sent."
        }
    ]
}
```
