Let's go through the steps to extract specifications and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have read and understood the document about the System Identification Mode.

Step 4: Extract specifications and express them using metric temporal logic formula.

Step 5: Format all the converted sentences in JSON.

Here's the output in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(SID_AXIS ≠ 0 → F(ParametersVisible ∧ ModeEntryAllowed))",
            "explanation": "This formula specifies that globally (G), if SID_AXIS is non-zero, then eventually (F) the parameters will become visible and mode entry will be allowed. The implication (→) captures the conditional nature of the specification."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(SID_AXIS = 0 → X(ErrorLogged ∧ ErrorSent))",
            "explanation": "This formula specifies that globally (G), if SID_AXIS is zero, then in the next state (X), an error will be logged and sent. This captures the immediate response to the condition where mode entry is prohibited."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(ModeActive → (StabilizeLikeMode ∧ SignalChirpsGenerated ∧ ResultsLogged))",
            "explanation": "This formula specifies that globally (G), when the System Identification Mode is active, the vehicle is in a STABILIZE-like mode, signal chirps are generated, and results are logged. The conjunction (∧) ensures all these conditions are met simultaneously when the mode is active."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the document:

1. The condition for parameter visibility and mode entry allowance based on SID_AXIS.
2. The error logging and sending when mode entry is prohibited.
3. The behavior of the system when the System Identification Mode is active.

These formulas provide a formal representation of the system's requirements, which can be used for verification and validation purposes in the software engineering process.
