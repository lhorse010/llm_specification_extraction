After carefully reading the document, I extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G((ZigZag_SaveWP ∧ Loiter_mode) → X(Manual_control))",
            "explanation": "When the auxiliary switch is set to 'ZigZag SaveWP' and the vehicle is in Loiter mode, the vehicle will be in manual control in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((ZigZag_mode ∧ Record_side) → F(Autonomous_flight))",
            "explanation": "When the vehicle is in ZigZag mode and a side of the field is recorded, the vehicle will eventually start flying autonomously."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Autonomous_flight ∧ Reach_other_side) → X(Manual_control))",
            "explanation": "When the vehicle reaches the other side of the field while flying autonomously, it will revert to manual control in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Range_finder_unhealthy ∧ Autonomous_flight) → X(Manual_control ∧ Stop))",
            "explanation": "When the range finder becomes unhealthy while the vehicle is flying autonomously, the vehicle will revert to manual control and come to a stop in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((ZigZag_Auto_Mode ∧ Registered_sides) → F(Automatic_operation))",
            "explanation": "When the ZigZag Auto Mode is enabled and the field's side points are registered, the vehicle will eventually start automatic operation."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Automatic_operation ∧ Sprayer_enabled) → F(Enable_sprayer))",
            "explanation": "When the vehicle is in automatic operation and the sprayer is enabled, the sprayer will eventually be enabled."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((ZigZag_Auto_Mode ∧ Low_position) → X(Stop_automatic_operation))",
            "explanation": "When the ZigZag Auto Mode switch is moved to the low position, the automatic operation will stop in the next state."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I excluded vague specifications and focused on clear and specific requirements. I also used the logical operators and temporal modal operators as specified in the problem statement.
