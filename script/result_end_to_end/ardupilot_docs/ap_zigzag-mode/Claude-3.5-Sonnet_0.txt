I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas as requested. Then I'll format the results in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(armed ∧ zigzag_mode → F(manual_control ∨ autonomous_control))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the vehicle is armed and in ZigZag mode, it will eventually be either under manual control or autonomous control."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(zigzag_mode ∧ switch_high → X(wp_a_recorded))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in ZigZag mode and the switch is moved to the high position, in the next state, waypoint A will be recorded."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(zigzag_mode ∧ switch_low → X(wp_b_recorded))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in ZigZag mode and the switch is moved to the low position, in the next state, waypoint B will be recorded."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(autonomous_control ∧ reach_waypoint → X(manual_control))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when under autonomous control and reaching a waypoint, in the next state, the vehicle will revert to manual control."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(zigzag_mode ∧ switch_middle → X(manual_control))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in ZigZag mode and the switch is moved to the middle position, in the next state, the vehicle will revert to manual control."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(autonomous_control ∧ rangefinder_unhealthy → X(manual_control))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when under autonomous control and the rangefinder becomes unhealthy, in the next state, the vehicle will revert to manual control."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(zigzag_auto_mode ∧ wp_a_recorded ∧ wp_b_recorded → F(auto_spraying))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in ZigZag Auto mode and both waypoints A and B are recorded, eventually the vehicle will start automatic spraying."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(zigzag_auto_mode ∧ reach_waypoint → X(wait_delay U move_side))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in ZigZag Auto mode and reaching a waypoint, in the next state, the vehicle will wait for a delay until it moves to the side."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(zigzag_auto_mode ∧ switch_low → X(¬zigzag_auto_mode ∧ zigzag_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in ZigZag Auto mode and the switch is moved to the low position, in the next state, the vehicle will exit ZigZag Auto mode and enter normal ZigZag mode."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications of the ZigZag and ZigZag Auto modes described in the document. They express the behavior of the vehicle in response to switch positions, waypoint recording, autonomous control, and mode transitions. The formulas use the temporal operators to describe the sequence of events and states that the vehicle goes through during operation.
