After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G((ZigZag_SaveWP ∧ Loiter_mode) → F(Manual_control))",
            "explanation": "Whenever the vehicle is in ZigZag SaveWP mode and Loiter mode, it will eventually enter manual control mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Auxiliary_switch = High ∨ Auxiliary_switch = Low) → F(Record_side))",
            "explanation": "Whenever the auxiliary switch is moved to the highest or lowest position, the vehicle will record the current side of the field."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Auxiliary_switch = Middle ∨ Flight_mode_change) → F(Manual_control))",
            "explanation": "Whenever the auxiliary switch is moved to the middle position or the flight mode is changed, the vehicle will enter manual control mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((Downward_facing_range_finder_unhealthy) → F(Manual_control ∧ Stop))",
            "explanation": "Whenever the downward facing range finder becomes unhealthy, the vehicle will enter manual control mode and come to a stop."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((ZigZag_Auto_Mode ∧ Registered_sides) → F(Automatic_operation))",
            "explanation": "Whenever the ZigZag Auto Mode is enabled and the field's side points are registered, the vehicle will automatically cover the field side to side at a programmable distance interval."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((ZigZag_Auto_Mode ∧ Sprayer_equipped) → F(Enable_sprayer))",
            "explanation": "Whenever the ZigZag Auto Mode is enabled and a sprayer is equipped, the vehicle will automatically enable the sprayer."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((ZigZag_Auto_Mode ∧ ZIGZ_LINE_NUM = -1) → G(Automatic_operation))",
            "explanation": "Whenever the ZigZag Auto Mode is enabled and the number of lines is set to infinite, the vehicle will continue automatic operation indefinitely."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((ZigZag_Auto_Mode ∧ ZIGZ_LINE_NUM = 0) → F(Stop_after_first_crossing))",
            "explanation": "Whenever the ZigZag Auto Mode is enabled and the number of lines is set to 0, the vehicle will stop after the first field crossing."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `ZigZag_SaveWP`: The vehicle is in ZigZag SaveWP mode.
* `Loiter_mode`: The vehicle is in Loiter mode.
* `Manual_control`: The vehicle is in manual control mode.
* `Auxiliary_switch`: The auxiliary switch is in the specified position (High, Low, or Middle).
* `Record_side`: The vehicle records the current side of the field.
* `Flight_mode_change`: The flight mode is changed.
* `Downward_facing_range_finder_unhealthy`: The downward facing range finder becomes unhealthy.
* `Stop`: The vehicle comes to a stop.
* `ZigZag_Auto_Mode`: The ZigZag Auto Mode is enabled.
* `Registered_sides`: The field's side points are registered.
* `Automatic_operation`: The vehicle automatically covers the field side to side at a programmable distance interval.
* `Sprayer_equipped`: A sprayer is equipped.
* `Enable_sprayer`: The vehicle enables the sprayer.
* `ZIGZ_LINE_NUM`: The number of lines is set to the specified value (-1 or 0).
* `Stop_after_first_crossing`: The vehicle stops after the first field crossing.
