I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(armed ∧ zigzag_mode → (manual_control U (wp_a_set ∧ F(wp_b_set))))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the vehicle is armed and in ZigZag mode, it should be under manual control until both waypoints A and B are set, with B being set after A."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(zigzag_mode ∧ wp_a_set ∧ wp_b_set ∧ auto_switch → F(autonomous_flight))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in ZigZag mode with both waypoints set and the auto switch activated, the vehicle should eventually enter autonomous flight."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(autonomous_flight → (¬manual_control U (waypoint_reached ∨ manual_override)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, during autonomous flight, manual control should not be possible until either a waypoint is reached or there's a manual override."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(range_finder_unhealthy → X(manual_control))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the range finder becomes unhealthy, the vehicle should switch to manual control in the next state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(zigzag_auto_mode → F(move_zigzag_direction ∧ F(cross_field)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when ZigZag Auto Mode is activated, the vehicle should eventually move in the ZigZag direction and then cross the field."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(field_crossed → X(wait_wp_delay ∧ F(move_side_dist)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, after crossing the field, the vehicle should wait for the specified delay and then move the side distance."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(zigzag_auto_mode ∧ sprayer_equipped → G(crossing_field → sprayer_enabled))",
            "explanation": "Globally, in ZigZag Auto Mode with a sprayer equipped, the sprayer should be enabled whenever the vehicle is crossing the field."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(zigzag_auto_switch_low → X(¬zigzag_auto_mode ∧ zigzag_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the ZigZag Auto switch is moved to the low position, the vehicle should immediately exit ZigZag Auto Mode and return to normal ZigZag mode."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications and behaviors described in the document for the ZigZag mode and its automatic operation. They cover aspects such as waypoint setting, autonomous flight, manual control, range finder dependency, and the behavior of the sprayer in auto mode.
