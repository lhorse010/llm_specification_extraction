After carefully reading the document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G( SmartRTL → (RTL_SPEED > 0 ∨ WPNAV_SPEED > 0) )",
            "explanation": "The vehicle must have a positive return speed (RTL_SPEED) or a positive navigation speed (WPNAV_SPEED) when in SmartRTL mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G( SmartRTL → (RTL_ALT_FINAL ≥ 0) )",
            "explanation": "The vehicle must have a non-negative final altitude (RTL_ALT_FINAL) when in SmartRTL mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G( SmartRTL → (SRTL_ACCURACY > 0) )",
            "explanation": "The vehicle must have a positive accuracy (SRTL_ACCURACY) for simplification and pruning when in SmartRTL mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G( SmartRTL → (SRTL_POINTS > 0) )",
            "explanation": "The vehicle must have a positive maximum number of points (SRTL_POINTS) that can be stored when in SmartRTL mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G( SmartRTL ∧ (SRTL_POINTS = 0) → ¬SmartRTL )",
            "explanation": "If the maximum number of points (SRTL_POINTS) is set to 0, SmartRTL mode is deactivated."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G( SmartRTL → (buffer_size ≤ SRTL_POINTS) )",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's buffer size must not exceed the maximum number of points (SRTL_POINTS) when in SmartRTL mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G( SmartRTL ∧ (buffer_size = SRTL_POINTS) → ¬(switch_to_SmartRTL) )",
            "explanation": "If the buffer is full (i.e., buffer_size equals SRTL_POINTS), the vehicle cannot switch to SmartRTL mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G( SmartRTL → good_position_estimate )",
            "explanation": "The vehicle must have a good position estimate when in SmartRTL mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G( ¬good_position_estimate → ¬SmartRTL )",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle does not have a good position estimate, SmartRTL mode is deactivated."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G( SmartRTL → (save_points ≤ 3) )",
            "explanation": "The vehicle must save points at a rate of at most 3 points per second when in SmartRTL mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G( SmartRTL → (distance_between_points ≥ SRTL_ACCURACY) )",
            "explanation": "The vehicle must save points only if the distance between the current point and the previous point is at least SRTL_ACCURACY meters when in SmartRTL mode."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `SmartRTL`: The vehicle is in SmartRTL mode.
* `RTL_SPEED`: The return speed of the vehicle.
* `WPNAV_SPEED`: The navigation speed of the vehicle.
* `RTL_ALT_FINAL`: The final altitude of the vehicle.
* `SRTL_ACCURACY`: The accuracy of simplification and pruning.
* `SRTL_POINTS`: The maximum number of points that can be stored.
* `buffer_size`: The current size of the buffer.
* `good_position_estimate`: The vehicle has a good position estimate.
* `save_points`: The rate at which points are saved.
* `distance_between_points`: The distance between the current point and the previous point.
