I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the converted sentences in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(altitude > 10 → X(descent_speed = WPNAV_SPEED_DN))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the altitude is greater than 10m, in the next state the descent speed should be equal to WPNAV_SPEED_DN."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(altitude ≤ 10 → X(descent_speed = LAND_SPEED))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the altitude is less than or equal to 10m, in the next state the descent speed should be equal to LAND_SPEED (which defaults to 50cm/s)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((on_ground ∧ pilot_throttle_min) → F(motors_off ∧ disarmed))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the copter is on the ground and the pilot's throttle is at minimum, eventually the motors will be off and the copter will be disarmed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(GPS_lock → horizontal_control = loiter_mode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if GPS lock is available, the horizontal control will be in loiter mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(¬GPS_lock → horizontal_control = stabilize_mode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if GPS lock is not available, the horizontal control will be in stabilize mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((motors_low_level ∧ -20 ≤ climb_rate ≤ 20 ∧ ¬accelerating) U[0,1] landed)",
            "explanation": "Globally, the copter is considered landed if motors are at low level, climb rate is between -20cm/s and +20cm/s, and it's not accelerating for 1 second."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(landed → (altitude < 10 ∨ (using_rangefinder ∧ altitude < 2)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, for the copter to be considered landed, it must be below 10m above home altitude, or within 2m of the ground if using a rangefinder."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(LGR_WOW_PIN_enabled → (descent_rate_limit_increased ∧ accelerometer_range_increased))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the Weight on Wheels (WoW) switch is enabled, the acceptable descent rate and accelerometer ranges for landing detection are increased."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the provided document about the Land Mode of the copter. They cover aspects such as descent speed at different altitudes, conditions for motor shutdown and disarming, horizontal control based on GPS availability, landing detection criteria, and the effect of the Weight on Wheels switch.
