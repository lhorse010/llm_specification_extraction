I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas as requested. Then, I'll format the output in JSON.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G((mode = ACRO ∨ mode = STABILIZE) ∧ throttle = idle ∧ ¬airmode → ¬stabilization)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in ACRO or STABILIZE mode with throttle at idle and airmode not active, stabilization is disabled."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((mode = ACRO ∨ mode = STABILIZE) ∧ airmode → stabilization)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in ACRO or STABILIZE mode with airmode active, stabilization remains active regardless of throttle position."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RC_OPTION = 154 → (arm_method = switch → airmode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if RC_OPTION is set to 154 and arming is done via switch, airmode is activated."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RC_OPTION = 84 → F(airmode_toggle))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if RC_OPTION is set to 84, it allows for future toggling of airmode in ACRO and STABILIZE modes."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mode = ACRO ∧ ACRO_OPTIONS[0] = 1 ∧ ¬(RC_OPTION = 84 ∧ ¬airmode_toggle) → airmode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, in ACRO mode, if bit 0 of ACRO_OPTIONS is set and not overridden by RC_OPTION 84, airmode is active."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(heli_type = traditional → ¬airmode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, airmode has no effect in Traditional Helicopter configurations."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(RC_OPTION = 154 ∧ ¬(arm_method = switch) → ¬airmode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, even if RC_OPTION is set to 154, airmode is not activated unless the switch is actually used for arming."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the provided document about the Airmode feature in ACRO and STABILIZE modes for copters. The formulas express the conditions under which Airmode is active or inactive, how it affects stabilization, and its behavior in different scenarios.
