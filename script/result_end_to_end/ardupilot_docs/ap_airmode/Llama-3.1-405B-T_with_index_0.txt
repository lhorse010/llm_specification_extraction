    "explanation": "If arming is setup via the rudder stick and throttle is lowered to idle in ACRO mode, the stabilization is removed."

    "formula": "G((rcx_option_arm_disarm_with_airmode ∧ arm_via_rcx_option_switch) → G stabilization_active_at_idle_throttle)",
    "explanation": "If a transmitter switch is used with RCx_OPTION ARM/DISARM with Airmode (option 154) and used to arm, then stabilization at idle throttle is still fully active."

    "formula": "G(rcx_option_84 → G airmode_active)",
    "explanation": "AIRMODE can be set to be active without using the RCx_OPTION switch to arm by setting an RC channel to RCx_OPTION = 84."

    "explanation": "Setting bit 0 of ACRO_OPTIONS will activate AIRMODE in ACRO mode (only) all the time, except if overridden by the above switch, if used."

    "explanation": "It isn't sufficient to just enable arming on an RCx_OPTION switch, you also have to actually use it for arming."
