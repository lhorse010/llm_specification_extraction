    "explanation": "If arming is setup via the rudder stick and throttle is lowered to idle in ACRO mode, the stabilization is removed."

    "explanation": "If a transmitter switch is used with RCx_OPTION ARM/DISARM with Airmode (option 154) and used to arm, then stabilization at idle throttle is still fully active."

    "formula": "G(RCx_OPTION = 84 → (AIRMODE_enabled ∨ AIRMODE_disabled))",
    "explanation": "Setting an RC channel to RCx_OPTION = 84 allows enabling or disabling AIRMODE in ACRO and STABILIZE modes directly."

    "explanation": "Setting bit 0 of ACRO_OPTIONS will activate AIRMODE in ACRO mode (only) all the time, except if overridden by the above switch, if used."
