    "explanation": "When the sticks are released/centered, the vehicle will actively brake, level, and be locked to a position in 3D space."

    "explanation": "With full stick deflection, the vehicle accelerates initially with MPC_ACC_HOR_MAX ramping down until it reaches the final velocity MPC_VEL_MANUAL."

    "formula": "G((throttle_stick > 0.625) → X( vehicle_taking_off))",
    "explanation": "When landed, the vehicle will take off if the throttle stick is raised above 62.5% percent of the full range from bottom."

    "explanation": "When the vehicle is landed and the throttle stick is pulled down gently, the vehicle will lower propeller thrust, detect the ground, and automatically disarm."

    "explanation": "Depending on configuration, whether you have a remote control, and whether there is an adequate altitude estimate, PX4 may switch to altitude mode, manual mode, land mode, or terminate."
