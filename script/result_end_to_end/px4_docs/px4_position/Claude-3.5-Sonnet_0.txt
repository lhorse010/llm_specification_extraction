Let's extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(centered_sticks → (hold_position ∧ hold_altitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the sticks are centered, the vehicle should hold its position and altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(roll_pitch_input → X(horizontal_acceleration))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when roll or pitch input is given, in the next state, the vehicle should accelerate horizontally."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_input → X(vertical_velocity_change))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when throttle input is given, in the next state, the vehicle should change its vertical velocity."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(yaw_input → X(angular_rotation))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when yaw input is given, in the next state, the vehicle should rotate angularly."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(landed ∧ (throttle > 62.5%) → X(takeoff))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the vehicle is landed and throttle is above 62.5%, in the next state, the vehicle should take off."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(¬global_position_estimate → X(failsafe_action))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when there is no global position estimate, in the next state, a failsafe action should be triggered."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(landing_sequence → F(on_ground ∧ disarmed))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the landing sequence is initiated, eventually the vehicle should be on the ground and disarmed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((on_ground ∧ stabilized_mode ∧ low_throttle) → F(disarmed))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the vehicle is on the ground in stabilized mode with low throttle, it should eventually be disarmed."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications extracted from the document, focusing on the behavior of the vehicle in Position Mode for multicopters. The formulas describe the expected responses to various inputs and situations, including stick positions, takeoff conditions, landing sequences, and failsafe actions.
