I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the converted sentences in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(¬global_3d_position_estimate → ¬mission_mode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if there is no global 3D position estimate, then the mission mode cannot be engaged."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(¬armed → ¬mission_mode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is not armed, then the mission mode cannot be engaged."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((mission_mode ∧ ¬mission_stored) → F(hold ∨ wait))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if in mission mode and no mission is stored, eventually the vehicle will hold (if flying) or wait (if landed)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((mission_mode ∧ mission_stored ∧ flying) → X(execute_mission))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if in mission mode with a stored mission and the vehicle is flying, in the next state it will execute the mission from the current step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((mission_mode ∧ mission_stored ∧ landed ∧ ¬takeoff_item) → F(fly_to_min_altitude U execute_mission))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if in mission mode with a stored mission, the vehicle is landed, and there's no takeoff item, eventually it will fly to minimum altitude until it executes the remainder of the mission."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_paused → (¬mission_mode U mission_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the mission is paused, it remains not in mission mode until it is switched back to mission mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((mission_resumed ∧ ¬was_capturing_images) → F(head_to_original_waypoint))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the mission is resumed and it was not capturing images, eventually it will head towards the original waypoint it was heading to before pausing."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((mission_resumed ∧ was_capturing_images) → F(head_to_last_waypoint U retrace_path))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the mission is resumed and it was capturing images, eventually it will head to the last waypoint it passed through, until it retraces its path."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_uploaded → X(active_mission_item = 1))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if a mission is uploaded, in the next state the current active mission item is set to 1."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((mission_feasibility_check_fail) → ¬mission_start)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if any mission feasibility check fails, the mission cannot be started."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the document, focusing on the conditions for engaging mission mode, mission execution behavior, pausing and resuming missions, and mission feasibility checks. The formulas use the temporal operators G (globally), F (finally), X (next), and U (until) to express the temporal relationships between different states and events in the mission execution process.
