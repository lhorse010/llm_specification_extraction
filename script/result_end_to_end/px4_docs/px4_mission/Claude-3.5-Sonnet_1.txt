I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the converted sentences in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(¬global_3d_position_estimate → ¬mission_mode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if there is no global 3D position estimate, then mission mode cannot be engaged."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(¬armed → ¬mission_mode)",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the vehicle is not armed, then mission mode cannot be engaged."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_mode ∧ ¬mission_stored → hold_or_wait)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in mission mode and no mission is stored, the vehicle will hold if flying or wait if landed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_mode ∧ mission_stored ∧ flying → execute_mission)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in mission mode with a stored mission and the vehicle is flying, it will execute the mission from the current step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_mode ∧ mission_stored ∧ landed → (execute_mission ∨ (¬takeoff_item → fly_to_min_altitude)))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in mission mode with a stored mission and the vehicle is landed, it will execute the mission or fly to minimum altitude if there's no takeoff item."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(rc_stick_movement → X(position_mode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, RC stick movement will change the vehicle to Position mode in the next state, unless handling a critical battery failsafe."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_paused ∧ ¬image_capture → F(resume_to_current_waypoint))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the mission is paused and not capturing images, eventually it will resume towards the current waypoint when restarted."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_paused ∧ image_capture → F(resume_to_last_waypoint))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the mission is paused while capturing images, eventually it will resume towards the last waypoint when restarted."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_upload → X(active_mission_item = 1))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when a mission is uploaded, in the next state the current active mission item is set to 1."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(mission_start ∧ ¬takeoff_item → F(ascend_to_min_takeoff_altitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when a mission starts without a takeoff item, eventually the vehicle will ascend to the minimum takeoff altitude."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications from the provided document, focusing on the clear and specific requirements for the mission mode in multicopter vehicles.
