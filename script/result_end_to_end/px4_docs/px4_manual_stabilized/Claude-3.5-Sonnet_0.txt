Let's extract the specifications and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G((centered_sticks) → X(level_attitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the control sticks are centered, then in the next state, the vehicle's attitude should be level."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((¬centered_sticks) → (roll_pitch_control_angle ∧ yaw_control_rate ∧ throttle_control_altitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when the sticks are not centered, roll and pitch sticks control the angle, yaw stick controls the rate of rotation, and throttle controls altitude/speed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((release_sticks) → F(centered_sticks))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the sticks are released, they will eventually return to the center deadzone."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((centered_roll_pitch) → F(level_attitude ∧ stop_movement))",
            "explanation": "Globally, if the roll and pitch sticks are centered, the vehicle will eventually level out and stop moving."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(manual_control_input)",
            "explanation": "Globally, manual control input (such as RC control or joystick) is required."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((roll_pitch_input) → X(autopilot_stabilize_attitude))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when roll or pitch input is given, in the next state, the autopilot will assist in stabilizing the attitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G((yaw_input) → X(autopilot_stabilize_rate))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when yaw input is given, in the next state, the autopilot will assist in stabilizing the attitude rate."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(throttle_input → X(direct_control_allocation))",
            "explanation": "Globally, throttle input is directly sent to control allocation in the next state."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications of the Stabilized Mode for Multicopters as described in the document. They cover the behavior of the vehicle in response to stick inputs, the role of the autopilot in stabilizing attitude and rate, and the direct control of throttle.
