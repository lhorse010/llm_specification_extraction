    "explanation": "Globally, when roll and pitch sticks are within the deadzone, eventually the roll and pitch angles will be approximately zero, leveling the vehicle."

  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G(|roll_stick| > deadzone → roll_angle ≈ k * roll_stick)",
    "explanation": "Globally, when the roll stick is outside the deadzone, the roll angle is proportional to the stick input, where k is a scaling factor."

    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(|pitch_stick| > deadzone → pitch_angle ≈ k * pitch_stick)",

  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(vertical_speed ≈ k * (throttle_stick - hover_throttle))",
    "explanation": "Globally, the vertical speed is proportional to the difference between the throttle stick position and the hover throttle position, where k is a scaling factor."

    "explanation": "Globally, if there's no manual control input, in the next state the mode will not be stabilized."
  },
  {
    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G((mode = manual) → (mode = stabilized))",
    "explanation": "Globally, if the mode is set to manual, it implies that the mode is stabilized."
