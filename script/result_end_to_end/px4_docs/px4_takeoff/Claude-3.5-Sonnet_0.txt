Let's go through the steps to extract specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas.

Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
I have thoroughly read the provided document about the Takeoff Mode for Multicopters.

Step 4: Extract specifications and express them using metric temporal logic formula.
Step 5: Format all the converted sentences in JSON.

Here's the output formatted in JSON with the extracted specifications expressed in MTL:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(TakeoffMode → F(Altitude = MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in Takeoff Mode, the vehicle will eventually reach the altitude defined in MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(TakeoffMode ∧ ¬ValidLocalPosition → ¬Armed)",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in Takeoff Mode and there is no valid local position estimate, the vehicle cannot be armed."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(TakeoffMode ∧ Flying ∧ X(¬ValidLocalPosition) → X(Failsafe))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in Takeoff Mode and flying, if in the next state there is no valid local position estimate, then in the next state the vehicle will enter failsafe mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(TakeoffMode ∧ RCStickMovement ∧ ¬CriticalBatteryFailsafe → X(PositionMode))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in Takeoff Mode, if there is RC stick movement and no critical battery failsafe, then in the next state the vehicle will switch to Position Mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(TakeoffMode ∧ FailureDetected → X(EnginesStopped))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in Takeoff Mode, if a failure is detected, then in the next state the engines will be stopped."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(TakeoffMode → ¬UserIntervention U (Altitude = MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT))",
            "explanation": "Globally, when in Takeoff Mode, no user intervention is required until the vehicle reaches the specified takeoff altitude."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications extracted from the document, expressing them in a formal logical notation. The formulas cover the automatic nature of the takeoff, altitude requirements, position estimate requirements, mode switching conditions, and safety features like the Failure Detector.
