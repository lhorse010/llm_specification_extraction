I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then I'll format the converted sentences in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(¬armed → ¬followMeMode)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle must be armed when switching to Follow-Me mode. This is represented as: globally, if the vehicle is not armed, it cannot be in Follow-Me mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(followMeMode → validLocalPosition)",
            "explanation": "Follow-Me mode requires at least a valid local position estimate. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle is in Follow-Me mode, it must have a valid local position."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(followMeMode ∧ ¬validLocalPosition → X(¬followMeMode))",
            "explanation": "Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate. This is represented as: globally, if the vehicle is in Follow-Me mode and loses valid local position, in the next state it will not be in Follow-Me mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(followMeMode → (windWithinLimits ∧ flightTimeWithinLimits))",
            "explanation": "Follow-Me mode requires wind and flight time to be within allowed limits. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle is in Follow-Me mode, both wind and flight time must be within their specified limits."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(followMeMode → followTargetPositionAvailable)",
            "explanation": "The follow target must be able to supply position information. This is represented as: globally, if the vehicle is in Follow-Me mode, the follow target's position must be available."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(followMeMode → F(altitude ≥ minSafetyAltitude))",
            "explanation": "When switching to Follow-Me mode, the copter will first ascend to a minimum safety altitude. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle enters Follow-Me mode, it will eventually reach an altitude greater than or equal to the minimum safety altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(followMeMode → vehicleFacingTarget)",
            "explanation": "The copter will always adjust its heading to face the target. This is represented as: globally, if the vehicle is in Follow-Me mode, it must be facing the target."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications for the Follow-Me mode as described in the document. They cover requirements for arming, position estimation, failsafe behavior, environmental conditions, target information availability, safety altitude, and vehicle orientation.
