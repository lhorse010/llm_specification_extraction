Based on the provided document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(valid_local_position_estimate → can_switch_to_follow_me_mode)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle can switch to Follow-Me mode only if it has a valid local position estimate."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → ¬can_arm)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle cannot be armed while in Follow-Me mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → (wind_within_limits ∧ flight_time_within_limits))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle can be in Follow-Me mode only if the wind and flight time are within allowed limits."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → (follow_target_supplies_position_information ∧ follow_target_is_multicopter))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle can be in Follow-Me mode only if the follow target supplies position information and is a multicopter."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → (follow_height ≥ 1m ∧ follow_distance ≥ 8m))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will follow the target at a height of at least 1 meter and a distance of at least 8 meters."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → (follow_angle ≥ 0° ∧ follow_angle ≤ 360°))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will follow the target at an angle between 0 degrees and 360 degrees."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → (follow_height_controlled_by_throttle ∧ follow_distance_controlled_by_pitch ∧ follow_angle_controlled_by_roll))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle's follow height, distance, and angle are controlled by the throttle, pitch, and roll inputs, respectively."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(exit_follow_me_mode → (follow_height_reset ∧ follow_distance_reset ∧ follow_angle_reset))",
            "explanation": "When exiting Follow-Me mode, the vehicle's follow height, distance, and angle are reset to their default values."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → (safety_altitude ≥ 1m ∧ follow_height ≥ safety_altitude))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will follow the target at a height that is at least as high as the safety altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → (follow_distance ≥ 12m → GPS_bias_not_significant))",
            "explanation": "If the follow distance is set to more than 12 meters, the GPS bias is not significant."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have excluded some specifications that are not clear or specific, as per the requirement. Additionally, I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `in_follow_me_mode`: The vehicle is in Follow-Me mode.
* `valid_local_position_estimate`: The vehicle has a valid local position estimate.
* `can_switch_to_follow_me_mode`: The vehicle can switch to Follow-Me mode.
* `can_arm`: The vehicle can be armed.
* `wind_within_limits`: The wind is within allowed limits.
* `flight_time_within_limits`: The flight time is within allowed limits.
* `follow_target_supplies_position_information`: The follow target supplies position information.
* `follow_target_is_multicopter`: The follow target is a multicopter.
* `follow_height`: The vehicle's follow height.
* `follow_distance`: The vehicle's follow distance.
* `follow_angle`: The vehicle's follow angle.
* `safety_altitude`: The safety altitude.
* `GPS_bias_not_significant`: The GPS bias is not significant.
