    "formula": "G(¬armed → ¬followMeMode)",
    "explanation": "The vehicle must be armed when switching to Follow-Me mode. This is represented as: globally, if the vehicle is not armed, it cannot be in Follow-Me mode."

    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G(followMeMode → validLocalPosition)",
    "explanation": "Follow-Me mode requires at least a valid local position estimate. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle is in Follow-Me mode, it must have a valid local position."
  },

    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(followMeMode ∧ ¬validLocalPosition → X(¬followMeMode))",
    "explanation": "Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate. This is represented as: globally, if the vehicle is in Follow-Me mode and loses valid local position, in the next state it will not be in Follow-Me mode."
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G(followMeMode → (windWithinLimits ∧ flightTimeWithinLimits))",
    "explanation": "Follow-Me mode requires wind and flight time to be within allowed limits. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle is in Follow-Me mode, both wind and flight time must be within their specified limits."

    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(followMeMode → followTargetPositionAvailable)",
    "explanation": "The follow target must be able to supply position information. This is represented as: globally, if the vehicle is in Follow-Me mode, the follow target's position must be available."

    "formula": "G(followMeMode → F(altitude ≥ minSafetyAltitude))",
    "explanation": "When switching to Follow-Me mode, the copter will first ascend to a minimum safety altitude. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle enters Follow-Me mode, it will eventually reach an altitude greater than or equal to the minimum safety altitude."

    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G(followMeMode → vehicleFacingTarget)",
    "explanation": "The copter will always adjust its heading to face the target. This is represented as: globally, if the vehicle is in Follow-Me mode, it must be facing the target."
