    "index": 0,
    "formula": "G(¬armed → ¬follow_me_mode)",
    "explanation": "The vehicle must always be armed when switching to follow-me mode. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is not armed, it cannot be in follow-me mode."
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G(follow_me_mode → valid_local_position)",
    "explanation": "Follow-me mode requires at least a valid local position estimate. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in follow-me mode, it must have a valid local position."
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(follow_me_mode ∧ ¬valid_local_position → X(failsafe))",
    "explanation": "Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in follow-me mode and loses valid local position, in the next state it will enter failsafe."
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G(follow_me_mode → (wind_within_limits ∧ flight_time_within_limits))",
    "explanation": "Follow-me mode requires wind and flight time to be within allowed limits. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in follow-me mode, both wind and flight time must be within specified limits."
  },
  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(follow_me_mode → follow_target_position_available)",
    "explanation": "The follow target must be able to supply position information. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in follow-me mode, the follow target's position must be available."
  },
  {
    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G(follow_me_mode → F(altitude ≥ min_safety_altitude))",
    "explanation": "When entering follow-me mode, the copter will first ascend to a minimum safety altitude. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle enters follow-me mode, it will eventually reach an altitude greater than or equal to the minimum safety altitude."
  },
  {
    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G(follow_me_mode → (altitude_mode = 2D ∨ altitude_mode = 2D_terrain ∨ altitude_mode = 3D))",
    "explanation": "The altitude control mode must be one of the three specified modes. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in follow-me mode, the altitude mode must be either 2D, 2D + Terrain, or 3D tracking."
