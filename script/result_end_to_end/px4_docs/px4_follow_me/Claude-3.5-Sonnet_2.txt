I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the converted sentences in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(¬armed → ¬follow_me_mode)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle must be armed when switching to follow-me mode. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle is not armed, it cannot be in follow-me mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_me_mode → valid_local_position)",
            "explanation": "Follow-me mode requires at least a valid local position estimate. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle is in follow-me mode, it must have a valid local position."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_me_mode ∧ ¬valid_local_position → X(failsafe))",
            "explanation": "Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle is in follow-me mode and loses valid local position, in the next state it will enter failsafe mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_me_mode → (wind_within_limits ∧ flight_time_within_limits))",
            "explanation": "Follow-me mode requires wind and flight time are within allowed limits. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle is in follow-me mode, both wind and flight time must be within specified limits."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_me_mode → multicopter_or_vtol_mc)",
            "explanation": "This mode is currently only supported on multicopter (or VTOL in MC mode). This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle is in follow-me mode, it must be a multicopter or VTOL in MC mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_me_mode → target_position_available)",
            "explanation": "The follow target must be able to supply position information. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle is in follow-me mode, the target position must be available."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_me_mode → F(altitude ≥ min_safety_altitude))",
            "explanation": "The copter will first ascend to minimum safety altitude. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle enters follow-me mode, it will eventually reach an altitude greater than or equal to the minimum safety altitude."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(follow_me_mode → (follow_height ≥ 1 ∧ follow_distance ≥ 8))",
            "explanation": "By default, the vehicle follows from directly behind the target at a distance of 8 meters, and a height of 8 meters above the home position. The minimum follow height is 1 meter. This is expressed as: globally, if the vehicle is in follow-me mode, the follow height must be at least 1 meter and the follow distance at least 8 meters."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications for the Follow-Me mode as described in the document. They focus on the clear and specific requirements, excluding vague specifications as requested.
