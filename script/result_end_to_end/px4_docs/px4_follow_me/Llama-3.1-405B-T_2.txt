Based on the provided document, I have extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(valid_local_position_estimate → can_switch_to_follow_me_mode)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle can switch to Follow-Me mode only if it has a valid local position estimate."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → ¬can_arm)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle cannot be armed while in Follow-Me mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → (wind_within_limits ∧ flight_time_within_limits))",
            "explanation": "The vehicle can be in Follow-Me mode only if the wind and flight time are within allowed limits."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → follows_target_at_specified_angle_distance_height)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will follow the target at a specified relative angle, distance, and height while in Follow-Me mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(exit_follow_me_mode → resets_to_default_values)",
            "explanation": "When exiting Follow-Me mode, the vehicle resets the angle, height, and distance values to their defaults."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → maintains_safe_distance)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will maintain a safe distance from the target while in Follow-Me mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → faces_target)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will always face the target while in Follow-Me mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → adjusts_altitude_according_to_control_mode)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle will adjust its altitude according to the selected altitude control mode while in Follow-Me mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_follow_me_mode → does_not_implement_obstacle_avoidance)",
            "explanation": "Follow-Me mode does not implement any type of obstacle avoidance."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have excluded vague specifications and focused on clear and specific requirements. I have also used the provided logical operators and temporal modal operators to express the specifications in MTL formulas.
