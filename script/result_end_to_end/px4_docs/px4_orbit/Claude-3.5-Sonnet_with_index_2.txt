  {
    "index": 0,
    "formula": "G(¬armed → ¬orbit_mode)",
    "explanation": "The vehicle must always be armed when switching to orbit mode. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is not armed, then it cannot be in orbit mode."
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "formula": "G(orbit_mode → valid_local_position)",
    "explanation": "Orbit mode requires a valid local position estimate at all times. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode, then it must have a valid local position."
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "formula": "G(orbit_mode ∧ ¬valid_local_position → X(failsafe))",
    "explanation": "If the vehicle loses its position estimate while in orbit mode, it will enter failsafe. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode and doesn't have a valid local position, then in the next state it will enter failsafe."
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "formula": "G(orbit_mode → (wind_within_limits ∧ flight_time_within_limits))",
    "explanation": "Orbit mode requires wind and flight time to be within allowed limits. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode, then wind and flight time must be within their specified limits."
  },
  {
    "index": 4,
    "formula": "G(orbit_mode → (multicopter ∨ vtol_in_mc_mode))",
    "explanation": "Orbit mode is only supported on multicopter or VTOL in MC mode. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode, then it must be either a multicopter or a VTOL in multicopter mode."
  },
  {
    "index": 5,
    "formula": "G(orbit_mode → F(on_circle_trajectory))",
    "explanation": "Once in orbit mode, the vehicle will eventually reach the commanded circle trajectory. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode, then it will eventually be on the circle trajectory."
  },
  {
    "index": 6,
    "formula": "G(orbit_mode ∧ on_circle_trajectory → rotation_speed ≤ 10)",
    "explanation": "The maximum velocity in orbit mode is 10m/s. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode and on the circle trajectory, then its rotation speed must be less than or equal to 10 m/s."
  },
  {
    "index": 7,
    "formula": "G(orbit_mode → (orbit_radius ≥ 1 ∧ orbit_radius ≤ 100))",
    "explanation": "The orbit radius must be between 1m and 100m. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode, then the orbit radius must be greater than or equal to 1m and less than or equal to 100m."
  },
  {
    "index": 8,
    "formula": "G(orbit_mode → centripetal_acceleration ≤ 2)",
    "explanation": "The centripetal acceleration in orbit mode must not exceed 2m/s^2. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode, then the centripetal acceleration must be less than or equal to 2 m/s^2."
