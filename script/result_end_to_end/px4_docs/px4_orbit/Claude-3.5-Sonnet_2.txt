I'll go through the document and extract the specifications, expressing them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(¬armed → ¬orbit_mode)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle must always be armed when switching to orbit mode. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is not armed, then it cannot be in orbit mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(orbit_mode → valid_local_position)",
            "explanation": "Orbit mode requires a valid local position estimate at all times. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode, then it must have a valid local position."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(orbit_mode ∧ ¬valid_local_position → X(failsafe))",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle loses its position estimate while in orbit mode, it will enter failsafe. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode and doesn't have a valid local position, then in the next state it will enter failsafe."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(orbit_mode → (wind_within_limits ∧ flight_time_within_limits))",
            "explanation": "Orbit mode requires wind and flight time to be within allowed limits. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode, then wind and flight time must be within their specified limits."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(orbit_mode → (multicopter ∨ vtol_in_mc_mode))",
            "explanation": "Orbit mode is only supported on multicopter or VTOL in MC mode. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode, then it must be either a multicopter or a VTOL in multicopter mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(orbit_mode → F(on_circle_trajectory))",
            "explanation": "Once in orbit mode, the vehicle will eventually reach the commanded circle trajectory. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode, then it will eventually be on the circle trajectory."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(orbit_mode ∧ on_circle_trajectory → rotation_speed ≤ 10)",
            "explanation": "The maximum velocity in orbit mode is 10m/s. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode and on the circle trajectory, then its rotation speed must be less than or equal to 10 m/s."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(orbit_mode → (orbit_radius ≥ 1 ∧ orbit_radius ≤ 100))",
            "explanation": "The orbit radius must be between 1m and 100m. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode, then the orbit radius must be greater than or equal to 1m and less than or equal to 100m."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(orbit_mode → centripetal_acceleration ≤ 2)",
            "explanation": "The centripetal acceleration in orbit mode must not exceed 2m/s^2. This is expressed as: Globally, if the vehicle is in orbit mode, then the centripetal acceleration must be less than or equal to 2 m/s^2."
        }
    ]
}

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications for the Orbit mode as described in the document. They cover requirements for arming, position estimation, vehicle type, trajectory, speed limits, radius limits, and acceleration limits. Some aspects of the mode, such as RC control details, are not included as they are more about user interaction than strict system specifications.
