    "formula": "G (mode_enabled → F (closest_point_on_circle_trajectory_reached ∧ slow_orbit_started))",
    "explanation": "Once enabled, the vehicle will fly as fast as possible to the closest point on the commanded circle trajectory and do a slow (1m/s) clockwise orbit on the planned circle, facing the center."
