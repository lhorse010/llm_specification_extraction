Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications that the vehicle needs to meet and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G (valid_local_position_estimate → mode_enabled)",
            "explanation": "The mode requires at least a valid local position estimate to be enabled."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (¬valid_local_position_estimate → failsafe)",
            "explanation": "Flying vehicles will failsafe if they lose the position estimate."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (mode_enabled → armed)",
            "explanation": "The mode prevents arming; the vehicle must be armed when switching to this mode."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (wind_within_limits ∧ flight_time_within_limits → mode_enabled)",

        },
        {
            "formula": "G (multicopter_mode → mode_supported)",
            "explanation": "The mode is currently only supported on multicopter (or VTOL in MC mode)."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (RC_stick_movement → (ascent_descent_control ∨ orbit_speed_control ∨ orbit_direction_control))",
            "explanation": "RC stick movement can control ascent/descent, orbit speed, and direction."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (MAV_CMD_DO_ORBIT → mode_triggered)",
            "explanation": "The mode can be triggered using the MAV_CMD_DO_ORBIT MAVLink command."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (mode_enabled → F (closest_point_on_circle_trajectory_reached ∧ slow_orbit_started))",
            "explanation": "Once enabled, the vehicle will fly as fast as possible to the closest point on the commanded circle trajectory and do a slow (1m/s) clockwise orbit on the planned circle, facing the center."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (left_stick_up_down → ascent_descent_control)",
            "explanation": "Left stick up/down controls speed of ascent/descent."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (left_stick_centered → altitude_locked)",
            "explanation": "When the left stick is centered, altitude is locked."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (right_stick_left_right → orbit_acceleration_control)",
            "explanation": "Right stick left/right controls acceleration of orbit in clockwise/counter-clockwise directions."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (right_stick_centered → current_speed_locked)",
            "explanation": "When the right stick is centered, the current speed is locked."

            "explanation": "Minimum radius is 1m."
        },

            "explanation": "Maximum radius is 100m."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (initial_rotation = 1m/s ∧ clockwise_direction)",
            "explanation": "Initial/default rotation is 1 m/s in a clockwise direction."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G (centripetal_acceleration ≤ 2m/s^2 → acceleration_limited)",
            "explanation": "The maximum acceleration is limited to 2 m/s^2, with priority on keeping the commanded circle trajectory rather than commanded ground speed."
        }
    ]
