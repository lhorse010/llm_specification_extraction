Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required output format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(activate_hold_mode → X(hover_at_current_position ∧ hover_at_current_altitude))",
            "explanation": "When the Hold mode is activated, the vehicle will hover at its current GPS position and altitude in the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(activate_hold_mode ∧ current_altitude < NAV_MIN_LTR_ALT → X(ascend_to_NAV_MIN_LTR_ALT))",
            "explanation": "If the Hold mode is activated below the minimum altitude (NAV_MIN_LTR_ALT), the vehicle will ascend to this altitude in the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_hold_mode ∧ RC_stick_movement → X(switch_to_position_mode))",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle is in Hold mode and there is RC stick movement, it will switch to Position mode in the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_hold_mode ∧ loss_of_position_estimate → F(failsafe))",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle is in Hold mode and loses its position estimate, it will eventually enter a failsafe state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(in_hold_mode ∧ (wind_exceeds_limits ∨ flight_time_exceeds_limits) → F(failsafe))",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle is in Hold mode and the wind or flight time exceeds the allowed limits, it will eventually enter a failsafe state."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(disarmed_vehicle ∧ invalid_position_estimate → ¬can_arm)",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle is disarmed and has an invalid position estimate, it cannot be armed."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I've used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `activate_hold_mode`: The Hold mode is activated.
* `hover_at_current_position`: The vehicle hovers at its current GPS position.
* `hover_at_current_altitude`: The vehicle hovers at its current altitude.
* `ascend_to_NAV_MIN_LTR_ALT`: The vehicle ascends to the minimum altitude (NAV_MIN_LTR_ALT).
* `in_hold_mode`: The vehicle is in Hold mode.
* `RC_stick_movement`: There is RC stick movement.
* `switch_to_position_mode`: The vehicle switches to Position mode.
* `loss_of_position_estimate`: The vehicle loses its position estimate.
* `failsafe`: The vehicle enters a failsafe state.
* `wind_exceeds_limits`: The wind exceeds the allowed limits.
* `flight_time_exceeds_limits`: The flight time exceeds the allowed limits.
* `disarmed_vehicle`: The vehicle is disarmed.
* `invalid_position_estimate`: The vehicle has an invalid position estimate.
* `can_arm`: The vehicle can be armed.
