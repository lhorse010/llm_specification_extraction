    "explanation": "Globally, when the control sticks are not centered, the angular rotation rate should not be zero, allowing for rotation around the respective axes."

    "formula": "G(roll_stick_input ∨ pitch_stick_input ∨ yaw_stick_input → F(attitude_rate_stabilized))",
    "explanation": "Globally, if there's input on the roll, pitch, or yaw sticks, eventually the attitude rate should be stabilized by the autopilot."

    "explanation": "Globally, when stick input is at maximum, eventually a high turn rate should be achieved for performing acrobatic maneuvers."

    "explanation": "Globally, when stick input is close to zero, eventually low sensitivity should be applied for small corrections."
