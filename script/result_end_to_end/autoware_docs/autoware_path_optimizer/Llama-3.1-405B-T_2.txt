Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(inside_drivable_area)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle should always be inside the drivable area."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(velocity = 0 -> outside_drivable_area)",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle is outside the drivable area, its velocity should be zero."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(distance_to_road_boundary > mpt.clearance.soft_clearance_from_road)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the road boundary."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(steering_wheel_stability)",
            "explanation": "The steering wheel should be stable along the trajectory."
        },
        {
            "formula": "F(optimization_failure -> previously_generated_trajectory)",
            "explanation": "If optimization fails, the previously generated trajectory should be used."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(computation_time < max_computation_time)",
            "explanation": "The computation time should be within the maximum allowed time."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(trajectory_length > min_trajectory_length)",
            "explanation": "The trajectory length should be greater than the minimum required length."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(ego_moving_dist < replan.max_ego_moving_dist)",
            "explanation": "The ego vehicle should not move more than the maximum allowed distance in one cycle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(goal_moving_dist < replan.max_goal_moving_dist)",
            "explanation": "The goal pose should not move more than the maximum allowed distance in one cycle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(time_passes -> optimization_executed)",
            "explanation": "Optimization should be executed at regular time intervals."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(input_path_change -> optimization_executed)",
            "explanation": "Optimization should be executed when the input path changes."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I've used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `inside_drivable_area`: The vehicle is inside the drivable area.
* `outside_drivable_area`: The vehicle is outside the drivable area.
* `velocity = 0`: The vehicle's velocity is zero.
* `distance_to_road_boundary`: The distance between the vehicle and the road boundary.
* `mpt.clearance.soft_clearance_from_road`: The soft clearance parameter from the road boundary.
* `steering_wheel_stability`: The stability of the steering wheel along the trajectory.
* `optimization_failure`: Optimization has failed.
* `previously_generated_trajectory`: The previously generated trajectory.
* `computation_time`: The computation time.
* `max_computation_time`: The maximum allowed computation time.
* `trajectory_length`: The length of the trajectory.
* `min_trajectory_length`: The minimum required trajectory length.
* `ego_moving_dist`: The distance moved by the ego vehicle in one cycle.
* `replan.max_ego_moving_dist`: The maximum allowed distance for the ego vehicle to move in one cycle.
* `goal_moving_dist`: The distance moved by the goal pose in one cycle.
* `replan.max_goal_moving_dist`: The maximum allowed distance for the goal pose to move in one cycle.
* `time_passes`: Time has passed.
* `optimization_executed`: Optimization has been executed.
* `input_path_change`: The input path has changed.
