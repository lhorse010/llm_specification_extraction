I'll extract the specifications from the document and express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Then, I'll format the results in JSON as requested.

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(inside_drivable_area → ¬stop)",
            "explanation": "This formula represents that globally, if the vehicle is inside the drivable area, it should not stop. This corresponds to the feature of making the trajectory inside the drivable area as much as possible."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(¬inside_drivable_area → X(stop))",
            "explanation": "This formula represents that globally, if the vehicle is not inside the drivable area, in the next state it should stop. This corresponds to the feature of inserting a stop point before the planned footprint will be outside the drivable area."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(ego_moving_dist > 3.0 → X(replan))",
            "explanation": "This formula represents that globally, if the ego vehicle moves more than 3.0 meters, in the next state replanning should occur. This corresponds to the replan condition when ego moves longer than replan.max_ego_moving_dist in one cycle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(goal_moving_dist > 15.0 → X(replan))",
            "explanation": "This formula represents that globally, if the goal moves more than 15.0 meters, in the next state replanning should occur. This corresponds to the replan condition when the trajectory's end moves longer than replan.max_goal_moving_dist in one cycle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(time_passed > 1.0 → X(replan))",
            "explanation": "This formula represents that globally, if more than 1.0 second has passed, in the next state replanning should occur. This corresponds to the replan condition when time passes."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(path_lat_change > 2.0 → X(replan))",
            "explanation": "This formula represents that globally, if the input path changes laterally more than 2.0 meters, in the next state replanning should occur. This corresponds to the replan condition when the input path changes laterally longer than replan.max_path_shape_around_ego_lat_dist in one cycle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(kinematically_feasible ∧ collision_free)",
            "explanation": "This formula represents that globally, the trajectory should be both kinematically feasible and collision-free. This corresponds to the main objective of the getModelPredictiveTrajectory module."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(optimization_failure → use_previous_trajectory)",
            "explanation": "This formula represents that globally, if optimization fails, the system should use the previously generated trajectory. This corresponds to the behavior described in the insertZeroVelocityOutsideDrivableArea section."
        }
    ]
}
```

These MTL formulas capture the key specifications extracted from the document. They represent the main features and behaviors of the path optimizer, including trajectory planning, replanning conditions, and safety constraints.
