Based on the provided document, I have extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(ego_moving_dist <= replan.max_ego_moving_dist)",
            "explanation": "The ego vehicle should not move more than the maximum allowed distance in one cycle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(goal_moving_dist <= replan.max_goal_moving_dist)",
            "explanation": "The goal pose should not move more than the maximum allowed distance in one cycle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(time_since_last_optimization >= 1.0)",
            "explanation": "The optimization should be skipped for at least 1 second since the last optimization."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(path_shape_around_ego_lat_dist <= replan.max_path_shape_around_ego_lat_dist)",
            "explanation": "The input path should not change laterally more than the maximum allowed distance in one cycle."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(trajectory_inside_drivable_area)",
            "explanation": "The generated trajectory should always be inside the drivable area."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(velocity_assigned)",
            "explanation": "Velocity should be assigned to the optimized trajectory from the velocity in the behavior path."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(steering_wheel_stable)",
            "explanation": "The steering wheel should be stable, i.e., the trajectory just in front of the ego vehicle should not change a lot."
        },
        {
            "formula": "F(insert_zero_velocity_outside_drivable_area)",
            "explanation": "Zero velocity should be inserted to the point firstly going outside the drivable area if the optimized trajectory is outside the drivable area."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I have used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `G` for "globally" (i.e., always true)
* `F` for "finally" (i.e., true at some point in the future)
* `ego_moving_dist` for the distance moved by the ego vehicle in one cycle
* `goal_moving_dist` for the distance moved by the goal pose in one cycle
* `time_since_last_optimization` for the time elapsed since the last optimization
* `path_shape_around_ego_lat_dist` for the lateral distance changed by the input path in one cycle
* `trajectory_inside_drivable_area` for the property that the generated trajectory is inside the drivable area
* `velocity_assigned` for the property that velocity is assigned to the optimized trajectory
* `steering_wheel_stable` for the property that the steering wheel is stable
* `insert_zero_velocity_outside_drivable_area` for the action of inserting zero velocity to the point firstly going outside the drivable area

These abbreviations are used to make the MTL formulas more readable and concise.
