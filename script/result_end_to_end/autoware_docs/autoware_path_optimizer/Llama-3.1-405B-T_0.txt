Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(inside_drivable_area)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle should always be inside the drivable area."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(velocity = 0 -> X(inside_drivable_area))",
            "explanation": "If the vehicle's velocity is zero, it should be inside the drivable area at the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(distance_to_road_boundary > mpt.clearance.soft_clearance_from_road)",
            "explanation": "The vehicle should always maintain a safe distance from the road boundary."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(steering_wheel_stability)",
            "explanation": "The steering wheel should always be stable."
        },
        {
            "formula": "F(optimization_failure -> X(use_previously_generated_trajectory))",
            "explanation": "If optimization fails, the vehicle should use the previously generated trajectory at the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(computation_time < max_computation_time)",
            "explanation": "The computation time should always be less than the maximum allowed computation time."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(distance_to_goal_pose < replan.max_goal_moving_dist -> X(replan_trajectory))",
            "explanation": "If the distance to the goal pose is less than the maximum allowed distance, the vehicle should replan its trajectory at the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(ego_moving_distance > replan.max_ego_moving_dist -> X(replan_trajectory))",
            "explanation": "If the ego vehicle has moved more than the maximum allowed distance, the vehicle should replan its trajectory at the next time step."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(time_since_last_replan > replan_time_interval -> X(replan_trajectory))",
            "explanation": "If the time since the last replan is greater than the replan time interval, the vehicle should replan its trajectory at the next time step."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I've used the following abbreviations:

* `G` for "globally" (always)
* `F` for "finally" (eventually)
* `X` for "next" (at the next time step)
* `->` for "implies"
* `distance_to_road_boundary` for the distance between the vehicle and the road boundary
* `mpt.clearance.soft_clearance_from_road` for the soft clearance parameter
* `steering_wheel_stability` for the stability of the steering wheel
* `optimization_failure` for the failure of the optimization process
* `use_previously_generated_trajectory` for the use of the previously generated trajectory
* `computation_time` for the computation time
* `max_computation_time` for the maximum allowed computation time
* `distance_to_goal_pose` for the distance between the vehicle and the goal pose
* `replan.max_goal_moving_dist` for the maximum allowed distance to the goal pose
* `ego_moving_distance` for the distance moved by the ego vehicle
* `replan.max_ego_moving_dist` for the maximum allowed distance moved by the ego vehicle
* `time_since_last_replan` for the time since the last replan
* `replan_time_interval` for the replan time interval
