Based on the provided document, I've extracted the specifications and expressed them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Here are the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "specifications": [
        {
            "formula": "G(launch_out_of_lane_module → (out_of_lane_collision → F(stop_point_inserted)))",
            "explanation": "If the out_of_lane module is activated and an out of lane collision is detected, then a stop point will be inserted in the future."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(ego_trajectory_footprint → F(accurate_time_to_collision_calculated))",
            "explanation": "If the ego trajectory footprint is projected, then the accurate time to collision will be calculated in the future."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(predicted_object → (filtered_object ∨ ignored_object))",
            "explanation": "If a predicted object is detected, then it will be either filtered or ignored."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(out_of_lane_area → F(time_to_collision_calculated))",
            "explanation": "If an out of lane area is detected, then the time to collision will be calculated in the future."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(time_to_collision < threshold.time_threshold → F(avoid_out_of_lane_area))",
            "explanation": "If the time to collision is less than the threshold, then the out of lane area will be avoided in the future."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(out_of_lane_collision → F(stop_or_slowdown_point_calculated))",
            "explanation": "If an out of lane collision is detected, then a stop or slowdown point will be calculated in the future."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(stop_or_slowdown_point → F(velocity_updated))",
            "explanation": "If a stop or slowdown point is calculated, then the velocity will be updated in the future."
        },
        {
            "formula": "G(stop_or_slowdown_pose → F(stable_for_min_duration))",
            "explanation": "If a stop or slowdown pose is used, then it will be stable for a minimum duration in the future."
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that I've used the following abbreviations in the MTL formulas:

* `G` for "globally" (i.e., always true)
* `F` for "finally" (i.e., true at some point in the future)
* `→` for "implies"
* `∨` for "or"
* `∧` for "and"
* `¬` for "not" (not used in this example)

Also, I've assumed that the variables used in the formulas are self-explanatory, but if you need further clarification, please let me know.
