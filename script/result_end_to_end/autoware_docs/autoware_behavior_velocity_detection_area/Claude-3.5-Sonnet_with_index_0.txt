    "explanation": "Globally, if a pointcloud is detected in the defined area, then the vehicle must stop within l meters (where l is the distance from the current position to the predetermined stop point)."

    "explanation": "Globally, if the distance to the stop line is less than the pass judge point and a pointcloud is detected, then in the next state, the velocity must be zero."
