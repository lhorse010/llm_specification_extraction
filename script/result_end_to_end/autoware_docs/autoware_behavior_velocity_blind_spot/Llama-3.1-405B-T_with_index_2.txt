    "formula": "G(stop → G¬go U (go ∧ G(go ∧ ¬stop) ≥ 2))",
    "explanation": "Once a 'stop' is judged, the module will not transition to the 'go' state until the 'go' judgment continues for at least 2 seconds to prevent chattering."

    "explanation": "When the module is in the 'stop' state and the 'go' condition is met, it will transition to the 'go' state."
