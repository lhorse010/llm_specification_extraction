    "explanation": "If an object is detected in the detection area and its path is in the conflict area, the vehicle must transition to the stop state."

    "formula": "G(pass_judge_line → ¬stop_state)",
    "explanation": "Once the pass judge line is crossed, the vehicle should not enter the stop state to avoid a rapid stop."

    "explanation": "Once the vehicle enters the stop state, it must remain in this state until the go condition is continuously met for at least 2 seconds to prevent chattering."
