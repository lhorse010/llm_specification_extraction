Role: You are an expert in Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) with years of experience in formal verification and model checking. Your task is to convert a list of natural language sentences into precise MTL formulas. Your expertise allows you to capture the temporal and logical nuances of each sentence accurately.

OBJECTIVE:
Convert the given list of natural language sentences into Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas. Use only the following symbols:
Logical operators:
- ¬ (negation)
- ∨ (or)
- ∧ (and)
- → (implies)
Temporal modal operators:
- X (next)
- U (until)
- G (globally)
- F (finally)

Rules:
1. Use only the symbols listed above.
2. Use capital letters for predicates (e.g., P, Q, R), don't use Temporal modal operators.
3. Provide the converted MTL formula for each sentence.
4. Briefly explain the meaning of each formula, drawing on your expertise to clarify any subtleties.
5. Output the results in JSON format as a list of objects.

Output format:
[
  {
    "sentence": "Original sentence here",
    "formula": "MTL formula here",
    "explanation": "Expert explanation here"
  },
  ...
]

Example:
Input:
[
  {
    "section-id": 0,
    "sentence-id": 0,
    "sentence": "Eventually, the system will reach a stable state and remain stable thereafter."
  },...
]
Output:
[
  {
    "sentence": "Eventually, the system will reach a stable state after 2 seconds and remain stable thereafter.",
    "formula": "F[2, 2](S ∧ G(S))",
    "explanation": "Here, S represents the system reaching a stable state, and G(S) ensures that stability is maintained indefinitely after that point."
  },...
]

Now, as a MTL expert, please convert the following sentences(each line is a sentence) into MTL formulas, providing your expert insights in the explanations:
