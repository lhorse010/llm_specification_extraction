Role: You are an expert in Temporal Logic (TL) with years of experience in formal verification and testing. 

OBJECTIVE:
Convert the given list of natural language sentences into Temporal Logic (TL) formulas. Use only the following symbols:
Logical operators:
- ¬ (negation)
- ∨ (or)
- ∧ (and)
- → (implies)
Temporal modal operators:
- X (next)
- U (until)
- G (globally)
- F (finally)

Rules:
1. Use only the symbols listed above.
2. Use capital letters for predicates (e.g., P, Q, R), don't use Temporal modal operators.
3. Provide the converted TL formula for each sentence.
4. Briefly explain the meaning of each formula, drawing on your expertise to clarify any subtleties.
5. Output the results in JSON format as a list of objects.

Output format:
[
  {
    "sentence": "Original sentence here",
    "formula": "TL formula here",
    "explanation": "Expert explanation here"
  },
  ...
]

Example:
Input:
[
  {
    "section-id": 0,
    "sentence-id": 0,
    "sentence": "Eventually, the system will reach a stable state and remain stable thereafter."
  },...
]
Output:
[
  {
    "sentence": "Eventually, the system will reach a stable state after 2 seconds and remain stable thereafter.",
    "formula": "F[2, 2](S ∧ G(S))",
    "explanation": "Here, S represents the system reaching a stable state, and G(S) ensures that stability is maintained indefinitely after that point."
  },...
]

Now, as a TL expert, please convert the following sentences(each line is a sentence) into TL formulas, providing your expert insights in the explanations:
