OBJECTIVE:
Extract specifications that the vehicle needs to meet from the document in #@#@#@#@#@DOCUMENT#@#@#@#@#@. Then express them using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas with the following symbols:
Logical operators:
- ¬ (negation)

- G (globally)
- F (finally)

Let's go through this step by step to ensure we arrive at the correct answer.
STEPS:
Step 1: Read the document thoroughly.
Step 4: Extract specifications and express them using metric temporal logic formula.
Step 5: Format all the converted sentences in JSON.

The output must strictly follow the OUTPUT FORMAT.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
    "specifications":[
        {
            "formula": "MTL formula here",
            "explanation": "Expert explanation here"
        },...
    ] 
}
```

REQUIREMENT:
1. Specifications should be clear and specific; vague specifications should be excluded.
